## Abstract

The brain is closely attuned to visceral signals from the body’s internal environment, as evidenced by the numerous associations between neural, hemodynamic and peripheral physiological signals. Here we show that a major mode of these brain–body cofluctuations can be captured by a single spatiotemporal pattern. Across several independent samples, as well as single-echo and multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquisition sequences, we identify widespread cofluctuations in the low-frequency range (0.01–0.1 Hz) between resting-state global fMRI signals, electroencephalogram (EEG) activity, and a host of peripheral autonomic signals spanning cardiovascular, pulmonary, exocrine and smooth muscle systems. The same brain–body cofluctuations observed at rest are elicited by cued deep breathing and intermittent sensory stimuli, as well as spontaneous phasic EEG events during sleep. Furthermore, we show that the spatial structure of global fMRI signals is maintained under experimental suppression of end-tidal carbon dioxide variations, suggesting that respiratory-driven fluctuations in arterial CO <sub>2</sub> accompanying arousal cannot fully explain the origin of these signals in the brain. These findings suggest that the global fMRI signal is a substantial component of the arousal response governed by the autonomic nervous system.

## Main

The communication of visceral signals from the body’s internal environment to the brain is essential for adaptive behavior. Central autonomic nuclei are closely connected to ascending arousal system nuclei that project diffusely to the cortex and subcortex, influencing wakefulness, affect and interoception [^1]. Pharmacological and electrical stimulation of central autonomic nuclei (for example, the solitary nucleus) produces widespread cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) synchronization, suggesting a role for these structures in arousal and wakefulness fluctuations [^2] [^3]. Recent evidence suggests that widespread low-frequency (0.01–0.1 Hz) signals recorded from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), referred to as the ‘global signal’ [^4], may also be a component of the central and peripheral nervous system arousal response [^5] [^6] [^7].

The ‘global signal’ is the most prominent spatiotemporal pattern observed in resting-state fMRI signals and accounts for a wide variety of previously observed features of these signals, including functional connectivity gradients [^7] [^8] [^9]. Global fMRI signals are prominent during changes of arousal as measured by electrophysiology, including EEG and local field potentials [^5] [^10], as well as changes in peripheral physiology, such as pupil dilation and peripheral skin vascular tone [^6] [^7] [^11]. Fluctuations in arousal during sleep have been shown to co-occur with simultaneous fluctuations in global fMRI signals and peripheral skin vascular tone, an indicator of sympathetic-mediated vasoconstriction [^6].

Here we examine the degree of coordination between global fMRI, EEG and autonomic signaling across multiple autonomic nervous system (ANS) effector organs. Using multiple independent datasets of multimodal fMRI, EEG and peripheral physiological recordings acquired during resting state, we demonstrate that a single, low-dimensional projection captures a major axis of covariation between global brain fluctuations and widespread peripheral physiological dynamics, including pulmonary (respiratory variability), cardiovascular (heart rate variability), exocrine (skin conductance) and smooth muscle (peripheral vascular tone and pupil diameter) systems. Spontaneous variations in autonomic arousal (K-complexes) during sleep, as well as direct manipulation of autonomic activity via deep breathing and intermittent sensory stimulation, induced a similar pattern of cofluctuations between the brain and body. Experimental suppression of spontaneous variations in end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO <sub>2</sub>) accompanying arousal demonstrated that arterial CO <sub>2</sub> could not explain the origin of these global brain fluctuations in resting-state conditions. Together, these findings provide evidence for the role of sympathetic-mediated vasoconstriction and ascending arousal system projections in governing spontaneous global fluctuations commonly observed in fMRI. This provides insight into long-standing debates regarding the origins and functional significance of global fMRI signals [^4] [^12].

## Results

### Global fMRI correlates with systemic physiological changes

Global fMRI fluctuations were extracted via the first principal component (PC1) of whole-brain fMRI time courses [^8]. The spatial and spatiotemporal distribution of the first PC derived from principal component analysis (PCA) and complex PCA (CPCA), respectively, is displayed in Fig. [1a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig1).

Fig. 1: Global fMRI fluctuations are associated with systemic physiological changes.

To examine the association of global fMRI signals with peripheral physiological signals, we computed a single global fMRI signal from the PC1 time course, such that positive signal fluctuations reflected positive fMRI signal in the cortex and negative signal in CSF compartments (Fig. [1a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig1)). Analysis of six separate resting-state fMRI datasets, several collected in the laboratories of co-authors (ME-REST and ME-REST-SUPP) and others conducted using publicly available datasets (HCP-REST, NATVIEW-REST, NKI-REST and YALE-REST), shows that global fMRI fluctuations covary with a multitude of peripheral physiological signals (Fig. [1b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig1)), including respiratory volume, heart rate, photoplethysmography (PPG) amplitude (a measure of peripheral vascular tone), skin conductance and pupil diameter. Analysis of the relationship between surface EEG power fluctuations and global fMRI signals in two simultaneous EEG–fMRI datasets (ME-REST and NATVIEW-REST) revealed prominent covariation between global fMRI signals and EEG power fluctuations across a wide band of frequencies (2–20 Hz). Most cross-correlation plots exhibit two distinct peaks for all signals, indicating temporal associations between physiological signals and the global fMRI signal at the following two distinct time lags: (1) a negative or zero time lag (−5 to 0 s) of the global fMRI signal, indicating that the physiological signal follows the global fMRI signal, and (2) a positive lag (0 to ~10 s) of the global fMRI signal, indicating that the physiological signal precedes the global fMRI signal.

To examine the temporal dynamics of the global fMRI signal associated with these physiological signals, we estimated impulse response functions [^13] ([Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Sec8)) of the global fMRI signal in response to an impulse of each physiological signal—ME-REST (PPG amplitude, α-EEG power and respiratory volume), NATVIEW-REST (pupil diameter) and NKI-REST datasets (skin conductance; Fig. [2a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig2)). The dynamics of the global fMRI signal exhibit a consistent pattern across all physiological signals—a positive peak followed by a stronger and more prolonged negative peak before returning to baseline.

Fig. 2: Joint cofluctuations of physiological and global fMRI signals.

The cross-correlation results establish pairwise relationships between global fMRI signals and physiological signals but do not provide definitive evidence of joint cofluctuations between all pairs of signals across time. To establish the latter, we performed a cross-decomposition between all pairs of signals and their lags via multiset canonical correlation analysis (MCCA; [Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Sec8)). Our aim was to examine whether the joint cofluctuations between all signals (and their time lags) can be extracted in a single latent dimension. Please note that although the relationship between global fMRI and EEG power is broadband (Fig. [1b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig1)), we included α-EEG (8–12 Hz) power as a single signal from the EEG due to previous reports of a relationship between α power and global fMRI signals [^14].

Application of MCCA to five resting-state fMRI datasets demonstrates that the first canonical component (Fig. [2b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig2)), representing the latent component with the maximal average pairwise correlation between all pairs of signals, captures moderate pairwise correlations between all signals, including peripheral physiology, neuronal (α-EEG power) and global fMRI (PC1) signals (for example, ME-REST— $\underline{r}=0.31$, _P_  = 0.001). Furthermore, the global fMRI signal exhibits the strongest pairwise correlations among all signals within the first canonical component across datasets. Time lags between signals in the first canonical component are presented in Supplementary Fig. [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#MOESM1).

### Autonomic arousal elicits brain–body cofluctuations

If the ANS is the source of these cofluctuations across brain and body, arousal induction should produce a similar pattern of cofluctuations as that observed at rest. To provide empirical support for this hypothesis, we performed event-related averaging on fMRI, EEG and physiological signals from (1) a cued deep inhalation task (ME-TASK), (2) a cued reaction time task (ME-TASK-CUE), and (3) K-complex onsets for participants who fell asleep during the resting-state session of the ME-REST dataset. The cued deep inhalation task (ME-TASK) was a sparse event-related design with individual cues separated by 1–2 min, allowing for an estimation of the physiological impulse response to isolated inhalations without overlapping responses. The cued reaction time task was a sparse event-related design similar to the deep inhalation task, but a button press was performed in response to the cue. Consistent with a previous study [^6], we also chose to examine physiological responses in and around K-complex onsets during stage II sleep, which was found in a subset of participants of the ME-REST dataset. The K-complex is a characteristic high-amplitude EEG event that occurs predominantly in stage II sleep and reflects phasic arousal events from internal (interoceptive) or external stimuli [^15]. K-complex annotations were performed in a semi-automated fashion on the EEG time courses of the ME-REST dataset ([Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Sec8)) and manually reviewed for accuracy.

Global fMRI signals (PC1) exhibit large amplitude fluctuations to isolated deep inhalations (ME-TASK; Fig. [3a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig3)). Consistent with the shape of the respiration response function described previously [^16], global fMRI signals exhibit a bimodal response to inhalation, with an early positive increase (~3 s) followed by a prolonged undershoot reaching its trough around ~14 s. In response to isolated deep inhalations, physiological signals exhibit temporal dynamics consistent with increased sympathetic nervous system activity and lead-lag timing that is similar to that observed at rest. An increase in heart rate, broadband EEG power (Fig. [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig3)) and peripheral vasoconstriction (decrease in PPG amplitude) is observed around the same time as the early positive increase of the global fMRI signal.

Fig. 3: Arousal changes generate joint fMRI-physiological cofluctuations.

The physiological response to a paced inhalation/breath-hold task was also examined (NKI-TASK). As opposed to the sparse event design of the inhalation task, this task was organized in sequential blocks with deep inhalations/exhalations followed by a prolonged breath hold (18 s). This task structure was also found to elicit strong amplitude fluctuations in peripheral physiology and global fMRI signals with peak/trough timings largely consistent with the deep inhalation task (Supplementary Fig. [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#MOESM1)).

To understand if this spatiotemporal pattern of physiological dynamics is not specific to deep breathing but to arousal induction more broadly, we examined physiological dynamics during a simple reaction time task (ME-TASK-CUE), where button presses were performed in response to intermittent auditory cues. While smaller in magnitude, a similar spatiotemporal pattern was observed in button responses (Fig. [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig3)), although the undershoot of the global fMRI signal occurred several seconds earlier in the button response compared with the deep inhalations.

We also examined whether spontaneous autonomic arousals produced similar physiological responses as those observed in resting-state, intermittent sensory stimulation and deep breathing. Event-related averages of physiological and global fMRI signals around K-complex onsets revealed a similar pattern of physiological response as that observed in deep breathing, as well as that observed spontaneously during rest (Fig. [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig3)).

### Global fMRI signals under clamped CO2 conditions

One potential source of global fMRI fluctuations in response to arousal induction is changes in cerebral blood flow due to levels of arterial CO <sub>2</sub>, a vasodilator [^17]. As has been shown in the current study and others [^11], changes in respiratory volume (respiratory rate and depth) can induce, as well as accompany, arousal state changes. Sustained changes in respiratory volume modulate the level of arterial CO <sub>2</sub>, thereby potentially changing cerebral blood flow [^17] [^18]. We sought to test if spontaneous fluctuations in arterial CO <sub>2</sub> served as the sole driver of the global fMRI pattern observed in this study. To do so, we examined the existence and spatial structure of global fMRI signals under both free breathing and under a ‘clamped’ CO <sub>2</sub> condition, where PETCO <sub>2</sub> was ‘clamped’ to the average level of each participant [^19].

The spatial structure of the global fMRI signal was estimated from the spatial weights of the PC1 and compared across free breathing and ‘clamped’ CO <sub>2</sub> conditions (Fig. [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig4)). The spatial structure of global fMRI signals was found to be nearly identical between free breathing and clamped CO <sub>2</sub> conditions (correlation _r_  = 0.95 of the spatial weights between the two conditions). Furthermore, global fMRI signals were similarly present in both conditions, as reflected in the explained variance estimates of PC1 between the two conditions (PC1 <sub>free</sub>, _r_ <sup>2</sup>  = 0.28; PC1 <sub>clamped</sub>, _r_ <sup>2</sup>  = 0.25; Supplementary Fig. [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#MOESM1)). Consistent with a previous report comparing the overall time-lag structure of global fMRI signals between clamped and free-breathing conditions [^20], we found that the spatiotemporal structure of global fMRI signals was similarly maintained in clamped CO <sub>2</sub> conditions (Supplementary Fig. [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#MOESM1)).

### Spatiotemporal dynamics of the global fMRI signal

To examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of the global fMRI signal and its anatomical distribution, we visualized brain maps at selected time points of a temporal reconstruction of the global fMRI signal through CPCA ([Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Sec8); Fig. [5c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig5)). An alternative approach of extracting the spatiotemporal pattern from voxel-wise cross-correlations with PPG amplitude, the physiological signal with the strongest association with the global fMRI signal, yielded the same pattern (Fig. [5b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig5)). Multi-echo fMRI data (ME-REST-SUPP) was used to isolate blood–oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes in the global fMRI signal via multi-echo independent component analysis (ME-ICA) denoising. Movies of the spatiotemporal patterns from CPCA and PPG amplitude cross-correlations are displayed in Supplementary Videos [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#MOESM3) – [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#MOESM6).

![figure 5](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41593-025-01945-y/MediaObjects/41593_2025_1945_Fig5_HTML.png?as=webp)

Fig. 5: Spatiotemporal dynamics of the global fMRI signal.

CPCA models the global fMRI spatiotemporal pattern as cyclical with mirrored globally positive (_ɸ_  = 3.2) and negative (_ɸ_  = 0.3) peaks (Fig. [5c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig5)). For clarity, we define the onset of the first complex principal component (CPC1) spatiotemporal pattern at _ɸ_  = 4.7, corresponding to the pattern of fMRI signals observed at PPG amplitude drops (_t_  = −0.8 s; Fig. [5a,b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig5), top). Note, the PPG amplitude cross-correlation maps are opposite those of the CPC1 maps (compare _t_  = −0.8 s (Fig. [5b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig5)) with _ɸ_  = 4.7 (Fig. [5c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig5))) due to the fact PPG amplitudes decrease around the onset of the global fMRI signal (Fig. [3a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig3)). The global fMRI signal exhibits a stereotypical pattern—(1) an early increase of fMRI signals in the white matter and CSF compartments, followed shortly by (2) a decrease in fMRI signals in the sensorimotor and visual cortices that (3) propagates across the gray and white matter and eventually reaches the large cerebral veins.

The presence of the global fMRI signal during changes in arousal (Fig. [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig3)) and its association with pupil diameter (Fig. [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig1)) suggest increased signaling of cortical noradrenergic projections from the ascending arousal system during global fMRI fluctuations. To examine whether any components of the global fMRI signal are potentially related to noradrenergic signaling from ascending arousal nuclei, we compared the spatiotemporal pattern to an atlas of noradrenaline transport (NAT) density (binding potential) derived from positron emission tomography [^21] [^22] (Fig. [5d](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig5)). In the cerebral cortex, NAT density is most prominent in the sensorimotor area, an area that shows early and prominent fluctuations within the global fMRI signal.

To explore the biophysical underpinnings of the global fMRI signal, we characterized signal decay properties at select time points of the cross-correlation of fMRI signals with PPG amplitude. Specifically, we estimated echo time (TE)-dependent and TE-independent signals ([Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Sec8)) by ordinary least squares fit of a monoexponential decay curve to the consecutively acquired echoes for each volume, $S\left(t\right)={S}_{0}{e}^{(\frac{-t}{{T}_{2^*}})}$, where _T_ <sub>2*</sub> (slope from a log-linear fit) and *S* <sub>0</sub> (intercept) estimate the TE-dependent and TE-independent signals, respectively. *T* <sub>2*</sub> estimates on a volume-wise basis reflect noisier estimates of BOLD signal changes relative to the ME-ICA denoised signals (Fig. [5c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig5)) but yield a similar global fMRI spatiotemporal pattern. _S_ <sub>0</sub> and _T_ <sub>2*</sub> maps were found to exhibit opposing changes in CSF compartments (including the ventricles and areas along the midline and insula) and posterior draining veins (Fig. [5e,f](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig5)). The opposing changes in *T* <sub>2*</sub> and _S_ <sub>0</sub> signals in these regions are suggestive of local blood volume changes with little to no blood oxygenation (BOLD) changes, in line with a bicompartmental model of fMRI signal composed of CSF and blood [^23]. The anatomical localization of these effects to the CSF compartments and cerebral veins was confirmed via comparison to standardized atlases [^24] [^25] [^26].

## Discussion

The composition and functional significance of the global fMRI signal are widely debated [^4] [^12]. This study characterizes a widespread pattern of cofluctuations between global fMRI brain signals and sympathetic-mediated physiological fluctuations in humans. This pattern of cofluctuations is replicated across multiple independent datasets of multimodal fMRI, EEG and peripheral physiology recordings. It is widespread across the body and entire nervous system, involving the brain, heart, lungs, exocrine and smooth muscle systems. It is also linked to changes in arousal state induced via deep breathing and intermittent sensory stimulation, as well as spontaneous fluctuations in arousal observed during sleep.

The cofluctuations between global brain signals and peripheral physiology exhibit a stereotypical sequence. The initial positive increase in the global fMRI spatiotemporal pattern is accompanied by roughly simultaneous increases in heart rate, respiratory volume and broadband EEG power, followed by a drop in the amplitude of the PPG signal. Widespread electrophysiological signals from the surface of the brain are commonly observed under abrupt changes in arousal [^5] [^7] [^15], consistent with our findings of prominent broadband EEG power fluctuations. The increase in heart rate around simultaneous peaks of respiratory volume is consistent with increased sympathetic outflow that inhibits the parasympathetic drive that slows the heart rate. The drop in PPG amplitude is indicative of vasoconstriction of peripheral blood vessels by sympathetic outflow [^27]. While pupil diameter and tonic skin conductance signals were only recorded in resting-state conditions, impulse response and cross-correlation analyses (Figs. [1b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig1) and [2a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig2)) provide potential insights into their dynamics during evoked conditions; these suggest an early increase in pupil diameter followed by an increase in skin conductance. An increase in pupil diameter is consistent with the inhibition of parasympathetic-mediated outflow to the iris constrictor muscles and excitation of sympathetic-mediated outflow to the iris dilator muscle [^28], and changes in skin conductance are consistent with sympathetic-mediated changes in sudomotor (that is, sweat gland) activity.

We observed that experimentally induced or spontaneous variance in ANS activity reproduces a similar sequence of physiological and global brain activity as that observed at rest. Here experimental manipulation of ANS activity was conducted through cued deep breathing and intermittent sensory stimulation, but other autonomic challenges may produce a similar effect. Respiratory variation is a strong modulator of peripheral ANS activity. Modulation of sympathetic outflow in the periphery through changes in respiratory rate and depth is a well-established finding in human physiology studies [^29]. Furthermore, neuronal populations within the medulla responsible for respiratory rhythm generation (preBötzinger complex [^30]) directly project to, and modulate, the activity of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus. While smaller in magnitude, intermittent auditory-cued button responses reproduced a similar sequence of physiological and global brain activity observed during deep breathing. A similar spatiotemporal sequence was also observed around K-complex onsets during sleep, consistent with a previous report [^6] that found increased global fMRI-physiological coupling around K-complex onsets during the NREM2 sleep stage. The coupling of ANS-related physiological signals and K-complex onsets is generally understood to reflect the central activation of sympathetic nervous system outflow [^31].

Spatiotemporal modeling of the global fMRI signal (Fig. [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig5)) revealed a characteristic time-lag pattern around drops in PPG amplitude; early fMRI signal increases in the CSF compartments and white matter are followed shortly by signal decreases in the primary sensory regions that propagate through the gray matter and (eventually) white matter. Cross-correlations of whole-brain fMRI signals with PPG amplitude, the physiological signal with the strongest association with the global fMRI signal (Figs. [1b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig1) and [2b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig2)), yielded the same spatiotemporal pattern as the CPCA approach. The sign and timing of the cross-correlation of PPG amplitude and whole-brain fMRI signals are in agreement with previous studies [^32].

Several features of the global fMRI spatiotemporal pattern are unlikely to be related to local neurovascular coupling mechanisms. First, the increase in fMRI signal in the white matter (with opposing decreases in the gray matter), simultaneous with PPG amplitude drops, is likely due to the mechanism proposed in ref. [^32] —differences in arterio-venous transit time between the pial vessels supplying gray matter and deep medullary vessels supplying the white matter. Decreased cerebral arterial blood flow results in temporally overlapping decreases of blood volume and oxygenation in pial veins of the gray matter, producing a net decrease in the fMRI signal due to the shorter arterio-venous transit time of oxygenated blood. In the deep medullary veins, however, a lag in arterio-venous transit time results in a temporary mismatch between blood volume and oxygenation fluctuations, such that early blood volume decreases precede oxygenation decreases, resulting in a net increase in fMRI signal in the white matter during this lag, eventually followed by a net decrease.

Second, decreases in gray-matter fMRI signal accompanying PPG amplitude drops also occurred together with signal increases in CSF compartments and large cerebral vessels. Early opposing signal changes in CSF compartments relative to the gray matter have been previously observed in studies of cerebrovascular reactivity [^33]. Periventricular white matter and ventricle regions are susceptible to partial volume artifacts from nearby blood vessels. During vasodilation of nearby blood vessels, the increase in blood volume reduces CSF volume, inducing a net decrease in the fMRI signal [^34]. This is due to the brighter CSF signal (long _T_ <sub>2</sub>) being displaced by the darker blood signal (shorter _T_ <sub>2</sub>). During PPG amplitude drops, positive signals are observed in the CSF compartments, suggesting the opposite response—a decrease in blood volume with increased CSF volume. Similar partial volume effects may explain opposing signals observed in large cerebral arteries relative to gray matter during PPG amplitude drops.

The hypothesis that blood volume fluctuations are the source of positive signals in the CSF compartments and cerebral vessels is further supported by our _T_ <sub>2*</sub> and *S* <sub>0</sub> (initial signal intensity) modeling with multi-echo fMRI data (Fig. [5e,f](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig5)). Simultaneous with drops of PPG amplitude, positive *T* <sub>2*</sub> and negative _S_ <sub>0</sub> signal fluctuations are observed in areas of high CSF density. Modeling results [^23] have shown that these opposing signal changes in _T_ <sub>2*</sub> and *S\* <sub>0</sub> signals are consistent with decreases in blood volume. It is important to note that our modeling of signal decay curves was limited to three echoes, and curve fits were likely to be noisy at the participant level. As such, these results should be further confirmed in data collected with more echoes.

Positive fMRI signal changes may also originate from changes in venous volume due to passive pressure effects. For example, downstream venous pressure varies with the respiratory cycle (due to a drop in intracoastal pressure with inspiration) and leads to venous blood flowing out of—and CSF flowing into—the cranium [^35]. This replacement of highly deoxygenated blood by CSF leads to an increase in the _T_ <sub>2</sub> <sub>*</sub> -weighted signal in areas with high venous density. Deep inspirations that often accompany arousals [^36] will exacerbate this effect. This relatively fast direct pressure effect may explain some of the early positive changes observed here, as well as the previously unexplained early upswing in the respiratory response function. This mechanism would be consistent with the spatiotemporal dynamics in our multi-echo denoised signals (Fig. [5c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig5)) and directly estimated *T* <sub>2</sub> <sub>*</sub> signals (Fig. [5e](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig5)), which show a prominent early anticorrelation in areas with high venous density, including the choroid plexus.

The spatiotemporal changes in fMRI signals described here are consistent with several ‘upstream’ causal mechanisms. An often-cited ‘upstream’ causal mechanism for global fMRI signals is respiratory-driven changes in arterial CO <sub>2</sub> concentration [^17]. Changes in breathing depth and rate and respiratory reflexes occur frequently in resting-state fMRI scanning sessions. Previous studies have demonstrated that participants in resting-state fMRI recording conditions exhibit frequent breathing changes and reflexes (for example, ‘yawns’ and ‘sighs’) [^37] [^38]. These behaviors likely induce variation in arterial CO <sub>2</sub> concentration in the cerebral vasculature, thereby modulating cerebral blood flow. Our findings that the topography and spatiotemporal structure of global fMRI fluctuations are maintained under experimental suppression of PETCO <sub>2</sub> fluctuations suggest that global fMRI fluctuations in resting-state conditions are unlikely to arise primarily from arterial CO <sub>2</sub> fluctuations. Another physiological source, high-frequency (aliased) cardiac pulsations, was also determined not to be a substantial contributor to fluctuations of the global fMRI signal, as these effects were largely attenuated in ME-ICA denoised time courses (Supplementary Fig. [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#MOESM1)).

The tight coupling between global fMRI and ANS-mediated physiological dynamics observed at rest, as well as their reproduction by experimental or spontaneous variation in autonomic outflow, provides evidence that the ANS (primarily the sympathetic nervous system) is the key ‘upstream’ driver of low-frequency global fMRI signals. Yet, these results leave open the proximal causal mechanism by which ANS activity and global fMRI signals are linked. Such a link may be direct via sympathetic innervation of the cerebral vasculature [^6]. Cerebral blood vessels, including the choroid plexus lining the ventricles, are profusely innervated by α-adrenergic receptors that may have a role in cerebral autoregulation [^39] [^40]. One source of cerebral vasoconstrictive effects may be the superior cervical ganglion that innervates blood vessels in the head and neck [^41] [^42]. Central control of cerebral blood flow from projections of noradrenergic brainstem nuclei (for example, locus coeruleus) may also have a role [^43].

We found that early fMRI global signal changes are prominent in areas of high NAT density [^21] within the sensorimotor cortices (Fig. [5d](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig5)). The high density of NAT in sensorimotor cortices from PET imaging is consistent with immunohistochemistry findings that show noradrenergic innervation of the cerebral cortex is characterized by a density gradient that peaks in the sensorimotor cortex and decreases rostrally and caudally [^44]. Thus, noradrenergic projections from subcortical ascending arousal system nuclei (for example, locus coeruleus and basal forebrain) may contribute to fMRI signal changes in these areas. Indeed, recent research [^45] has also found that burst-like optogenetic stimulation of the locus coeruleus preferentially modulates sensory areas of the rat cortex.

The functional importance of our findings is underscored by the prominence of these low-frequency fluctuations across multiple organ systems. Their induction by arousal suggests that the recruitment of these systems is in service of priming the body for action through heightened sensory receptivity and the shunting of metabolic resources to vital organs, including the brain [^46]. The concomitant electrophysiological and hemodynamic (and possibly glymphatic) changes in the brain likely serve the same objective. As one of the most metabolically active organs of the body, the supply of oxygenated blood to the brain is finely regulated to accommodate local increases in metabolism. Brain-wide fluctuations in cerebral blood flow, either arising from systemic vascular (vasoconstriction) or neurovascular mechanisms, may be an anticipatory mechanism of future increases in metabolic rate. Alternatively, it may anticipate or support a physiological process separate from oxygen metabolism, such as neurotransmitter synthesis or regulation of neuronal excitability [^47]. In this scenario, arousal-induced fluctuations of the global fMRI signal represent a component of a more general recruitment of multiple organ systems to anticipate future action.

Global fluctuations are a prominent component of low-frequency (0.01–0.1 Hz) fMRI signal recordings, explaining around 25% of the variance in whole-brain fMRI signals (Supplementary Fig. [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#MOESM1)). At the same time, the majority of variance in the low-frequency fMRI signal is uncorrelated with this component, which may reflect mechanisms separate from those underlying the global fMRI signal. It is likely that certain ‘downstream’ signal dynamics of the global fMRI signal (for example, effects in draining veins and ventricles) are not a direct result of neurovascular coupling mechanisms. However, our findings suggest that global fMRI fluctuations and concomitant physiological signal fluctuations are a regularly observed feature of the sympathetic-mediated arousal response and likely have a crucial role in normal physiological functioning.

## Methods

The following ten datasets were analyzed in this study: (1) a simultaneous EEG/multi-echo resting-state fMRI dataset (ME-REST) [^48]; (2) a simultaneous EEG/multi-echo respiration task fMRI dataset (ME-TASK); (3) a simultaneous EEG/multi-echo reaction time task fMRI dataset (ME-TASK-CUE); (4) a multiband accelerated single-echo resting-state fMRI dataset from the Human Connectome Project [^49] (HCP-REST); (5) a multiband accelerated single-echo fMRI dataset from the enhanced Nathan Kline Institute (NKI)—Rockland Sample [^50], including a resting-state (NKI-REST); (6) respiration task (NKI-TASK); (7) a supplementary multi-echo fMRI resting-state dataset [^51] (ME-REST-SUPP); (8) a multiband accelerated single-echo resting-state fMRI dataset with simultaneous pupillometry from Yale University [^52] (YALE-REST); (9) a simultaneous EEG/single-echo resting-state fMRI dataset from NKI [^53] (NATVIEW-REST); and (10) a multiband accelerated single-echo resting-state fMRI dataset recorded under a free-breathing condition and a PETCO <sub>2</sub> condition clamped to the average PETCO <sub>2</sub> for each participant [^19]. Dataset details and demographics are presented in Supplementary Table [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#MOESM1). MRI and EEG acquisition parameters are described in Supplementary Note [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#MOESM1).

### ME-REST, ME-TASK and ME-TASK-CUE data

Simultaneous multi-echo fMRI–EEG eyes-closed resting-state scans (ME-REST) were acquired from 11 healthy, right-handed participants (six female, mean age 25.9 years). All participants provided written informed consent, and human participant protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Vanderbilt University. Two resting-state sessions were recorded for four of the participants, creating a total of 15 scans. Simultaneous multi-echo fMRI–EEG respiration task scans (ME-TASK) were acquired under the same acquisition protocol for six healthy, right-handed participants (four female, mean age 30.5 years). Two task sessions were recorded for three of the participants, creating a total of nine scans. The respiration task experimental design consisted of a sparse event-related design with instructions to the participants to take a deep breath in response to an auditory cue (a constant tone). The interstimulus interval (ISI) between auditory cues was randomly jittered between the range of 60.55–131.25 s. Auditory cue timing was consistent across scans. One participant overlapped between the resting-state and respiration task sessions. Simultaneous multi-echo fMRI–EEG reaction time task scans (ME-TASK-CUE) were acquired under the same acquisition protocol for 12 healthy, right-handed participants (six female, mean age 25.6 years). The reaction time task experimental design consisted of a sparse event-related design with instructions to the participants to press a button in response to an auditory cue. For some participants (_n_  = 5), the ISI between auditory cues was set to 35 s ± 6 s, and for the rest (_n_  = 7), the ISI was randomly jittered between 8 and 89 s. Nine participants overlapped between the resting-state and reaction time task sessions.

### HCP-REST data

We analyzed eyes-open resting-state fMRI EPI functional scans from the HCP S1200 release [^49]. We randomly selected 30 unrelated, healthy young adults (17 female, ages 22–37 years) for our study with high-quality physiological recordings (confirmed through visual inspection; see note below on quality control procedure).

### NKI-REST and NKI-TASK data

We analyzed resting-state and task-fMRI breath-hold EPI functional scans and high-resolution anatomical T1w images from the enhanced NKI Rockland sample [^50]. We randomly selected 50 adult participants with high-quality physiological recordings (confirmed through visual inspection; see note below on quality control procedure) independently for each dataset (NKI-REST—33 female, ages 18–45 years; NKI-TASK—30 female, ages 15–45 years). Twenty participants overlapped between the two datasets. A single respiration task session was recorded per participant with a 1,400 ms TR. Two multiband accelerated resting-state sessions (TR, 1,400 ms and TR, 650 ms) were collected per participant. We selected the 1,400 ms (TR) acquisition for consistency with the ME-TASK dataset.

### ME-REST-SUPP data

As a supplementary multi-echo fMRI dataset to confirm findings from the ME-REST and HCP-REST datasets, we analyzed eyes-open resting-state data from the neurocognitive aging data release [^51] via OpenNeuro [^54] (OpenNeuro accession, ds003592). We selected 87 young adults with high-quality physiological recordings (confirmed through visual inspection; see note below on quality control procedure; ages 20–34 years, 20 female). Each participant performed two resting-state fMRI sessions during the study visit.

### YALE-REST data

For the analysis of pupillometry signals, we analyzed eyes-open resting-state fMRI data from the Yale Resting-State Pupillometry/fMRI dataset [^52] via OpenNeuro [^54] (OpenNeuro accession, ds003673). In total, 24 of 27 participants were selected for analysis based on quality control of the pupil recordings (16 female, ages = 21–37 years). Both resting-state fMRI sessions collected during the study visit were used.

### NATVIEW-REST data

To replicate EEG and pupillometry associations, we analyzed eyes-open resting-state data with simultaneous EEG–fMRI–pupillometry recordings from NKI [^53]. We selected 21 out of 22 total participants based on visual inspection of the minimally processed pupil diameter recordings (ten female, ages 22–51 years). The resting-state scans were approximately 10 min in duration (288 volumes) and were collected as part of a larger naturalistic viewing experiment with several visual and video-watching scans. For some participants (_n_  = 12), two resting-state sessions were collected, and both were used in our analysis.

### Free-breathing and ‘clamped’ CO2 data

To determine the effect of spontaneous variation in arterial CO <sub>2</sub> produced by changes in respiratory depth/rate on global fMRI dynamics, we analyzed resting-state fMRI data from 13 participants (nine female, ages 18–32 years) collected during free-breathing and clamped CO <sub>2</sub> conditions [^19]. All participants provided written informed consent, and human participant protocols received institutional ethics approval at the University of Toronto. In the ‘clamped’ condition, participants’ PETCO <sub>2</sub> levels were clamped to their average PETCO <sub>2</sub> level using the RespirAct breathing circuit (Thornhill Research). For the free-breathing condition, participants were allowed to breathe freely over the course of the scan.

### Quality control of physiological recordings

Peripheral physiological recordings tend to be noisy, with relative noise levels dependent on their placement location, participant compliance and movement. To ensure our analysis was not affected by acquisition artifacts of the physiological recordings, raw signals from all participants in each dataset were visually inspected before inclusion. Several qualitative criteria for each signal type were used to determine physiological signals for inclusion in the analysis. PPG signals were inspected for (1) clearly visible pulsatile waveforms across the entire recording session, and (2) the infrequent occurrence of high-amplitude noise artifacts. Respiratory belt signals were inspected for (1) clearly visible respiratory time courses reflecting the peak and trough of the abdomen during the respiratory cycle, and (2) the absence of prominent ceiling or floor effects/cut-offs at peaks of the respiratory waveform. The primary criteria for the minimally preprocessed pupil diameter time courses in the NATVIEW-REST dataset were the absence of multiple, long-duration (subjectively determined) eye closures. For the pupil diameter time courses in the YALE-REST dataset [^52], a previous exclusion criterion was applied such that the percentage of missing time points due to eye closures and blinks did not exceed 35%. Skin conductance time courses for the NKI-REST and NKI-TASK datasets were inspected for (1) prominent low-frequency fluctuations visible from background noise, and (2) the absence of extreme, sudden jumps/drops in baseline signal.

### MRI and EEG preprocessing pipelines

Descriptions of the MRI and EEG preprocessing pipelines for all datasets are described in Supplementary Note [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#MOESM1).

### Physiological and EEG feature extraction

Five physiological signals were extracted from the raw PPG, respiration belt, skin conductance and pupil diameter recordings. Heart rate variability and systolic peak amplitude (PPG amplitude) were extracted from the raw PPG signals. Respiratory volume [^55] was extracted from the raw respiration belt recordings. Low-frequency (0.01–0.1 Hz) tonic skin conductance was extracted from the raw skin conductance signals. We used minimally preprocessed pupil diameter signals extracted from eye-tracking recordings provided by the authors for the NATVIEW-REST and YALE-REST datasets. Example physiological signals from each dataset are displayed in Supplementary Fig. [7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#MOESM1). For comparison with fMRI signals, the extracted physiological signals were clipped at five s.d. from the mean (for outlier removal), resampled to the length of the functional MRI scan and filtered using a fifth-order Butterworth bandpass filter (0.01–0.1 Hz) excluding the tonic skin conductance signals that were already filtered. Please note that the minimally preprocessed pupil diameter signals from the YALE-REST dataset were already resampled to the length of the functional scan. Details of the preprocessing for each physiological signal are provided below. The preprocessing pipeline for the physiological signals (and EEG signals) is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. [8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#MOESM1).

Heart rate variability time courses were extracted from PPG time courses using the NeuroKit2 package ([https://neuropsychology.github.io/NeuroKit/index.html](https://neuropsychology.github.io/NeuroKit/index.html)) in Python. For the calculation of HR, the raw PPG time course was first filtered with a third-order Butterworth bandpass filter (0.5–8 Hz), followed by systolic peak detection. Heart rate was calculated from the period of time between peaks and interpolated to the same length of the raw signal with monotone cubic interpolation [^56]. For the extraction of PPG pulse amplitude signals, the amplitude of the systolic peaks (previously identified by the peak detection method) was interpolated with monotone cubic interpolation.

For the NKI-REST and NKI-TASK datasets, skin conductance signals were collected from the hand. Skin conductance time courses consist of a low-frequency tonic and a high-frequency phasic component [^57]. The tonic component reflects the slowly varying component of the skin conductance signal and has previously been studied in the context of fMRI [^58]. We extracted a narrowband tonic skin conductance signal matching the frequency content of spontaneous resting-state fMRI signals (0.01–0.1 Hz) with a fifth-order Butterworth bandpass filter (0.01–0.1 Hz).

For the YALE-REST dataset, we used minimally preprocessed pupillometry signals provided by the authors ([https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003673/versions/2.0.1](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003673/versions/2.0.1)). The minimal preprocessing pipeline consisted of four-point spline interpolation of eye blinks, low-pass filtering with a Butterworth filter (<0.5 Hz), removal of the first 10 s of recordings (to match the length of the functional scan) and resampling to the sampling frequency of the functional scan (1 Hz). We also used minimally preprocessed pupillometry signals for the NATVIEW-REST dataset. The minimal preprocessing pipeline consisted of linear interpolation of eye blinks, median filter of 0.2 s width and resampling to the frequency of the functional scan (0.47 Hz).

RV was calculated from respiration belt time courses using a recently developed Hilbert-based method [^55], implemented in NeuroKit2. High-frequency noise was first removed from the respiratory belt time courses with a Butterworth tenth-order low-pass filter (<0.75 Hz). Amplitude and phase components were then extracted from the filtered signal via the Hilbert transform. Following an iterated linear interpolation procedure of the phase time courses, respiratory volume was calculated as the product of the derivative of the interpolated phase time course (that is, the instantaneous breathing rate) with the signal amplitude (breathing depth/amplitude).

EEG power and vigilance fluctuations were extracted from averaged parietal and occipital lobe EEG channel time courses (ME-REST/TASK—P3, P4, Pz, O1, O2, Oz; NATVIEW-REST—P3, P4, P7, P8, Pz, POz, P1, P2, PO3, PO4, P5, P6, PO7, PO8, O1, O2, Oz) using the MNE-Python package [^59] ([https://mne.tools/stable/index.html](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html)). Time-frequency EEG power was extracted via Morlet wavelet filters (number of cycles = 15) to construct a filter bank ranging from 2 to 20 Hz (spanning δ, θ and α oscillation bands). For the ME-REST and NATVIEW-REST datasets, power was extracted from each signal in the filter bank and was cross-correlated with time courses from the PC1 of the fMRI data. The α power signals were computed through bandpass FIR filtering (Hamming window; 8–12 Hz) of the average channel time course, followed by the extraction of instantaneous amplitude via the Hilbert transform. For comparison with fMRI time courses in the ME-REST and NATVIEW-REST datasets, EEG power time courses were resampled to the length of the fMRI scan. Example EEG power time courses from a sample of participants in the ME-REST and NATVIEW-REST datasets are displayed in Supplementary Fig. [9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#MOESM1).

### K-complex annotation

Event-related averaging of fMRI and physiological signals around K-complex onsets was performed on a subset (_n_  = 7) of participants from the ME-REST dataset who fell asleep during their scanning session. K-complex annotations were performed in a semi-automated fashion. First, EEG time courses from frontal and central channels were automatically sleep-staged using the YASA package in Python ([https://github.com/raphaelvallat/yasa](https://github.com/raphaelvallat/yasa)) [^60], with default parameters. Following automated sleep staging, EEG time courses from sleep stage II were manually annotated for K-complex onsets according to AASM criteria [^61] using a custom bipolar montage. Separate K-complexes that occurred within a window of ~30 s were removed before event-related averaging to avoid overlapping responses.

### PCA

As previously described [^8], the zero-lag and time-lag structure of the global fMRI signal was modeled with PCA and CPCA, respectively. The PC1 of both PCA and CPCA extracts a pattern of global fMRI fluctuations that is closely correlated (in time) with the global mean time course. Standard PCA was used to extract the simultaneous statistical dependence between cortical areas of global fMRI fluctuations, and CPCA was used to extract time-lag statistical dependence (that is, traveling wave or propagatory behavior). In this study, we analyze the properties of the PC1 in volume space, including signals from subcortical structures, ventricles and cerebral sinuses.

CPCA involves the application of PCA to complex-valued time courses generated by the Hilbert transform. We extracted the CPC1 using CPCA on the complex-valued (bandpassed to 0.01–0.1 Hz) fMRI time courses temporally concatenated across participants. Time-lag information can be extracted from the phase representation of the complex-valued PC (via Euler’s identity). The phase representation encodes the time delay between voxels (in radians) within the CPC1. The time-lag information can also be visualized over selected time points via a temporal reconstruction (Supplementary Video [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#MOESM3)). Comprehensive details are previously described [^8]. In brief, we first divided the temporal phase time courses of the CPC1 into equally spaced bins (_n_  = 30). We then projected the complex PC back into voxel space to derive voxel time courses. Finally, we averaged the real-valued voxel time courses within the time points indexed by the equally spaced phase bins [^8]. This resulted in a 30-volume ‘video’ that visualizes the temporal evolution of a component. Both PCA and CPCA solutions were computed using a fast randomized SVD algorithm developed by Facebook ([https://github.com/facebookarchive/fbpca](https://github.com/facebookarchive/fbpca)). More details of the CPCA algorithm can be found in ref. [^8].

### Cross-correlation analyses

For the ME-REST, HCP-REST, ME-REST-SUPP, NKI-REST and YALE-REST datasets, cross-correlation analyses were conducted between the electrophysiological time courses and the PC1 time course. Product-moment cross-correlations were computed at the participant level, and group-average cross-correlations were computed by the mean of the participant-level cross-correlations. For comparability across datasets with different sampling rates, we interpolated participant and group-average cross-correlation functions with a cubic spline from −30 s to 30 s (time lag).

### Impulse response modeling of physiological signals

To summarize the temporal dynamics of all recorded physiological signals in response to fluctuations in global fMRI signals (that is, PC1), we implemented a linear systems modeling approach as described in ref. [^13]. Impulse response functions were estimated separately for each physiological signal through deconvolution of the physiological signal using a Gaussian process prior. A Gaussian process prior is used to capture the underlying smoothness of the physiological signal. The deconvolved physiological signal is estimated from the maximum a posteriori of the posterior distribution. As no single dataset contained all physiological signals, we superimposed the deconvolved physiological impulse responses from the following three separate datasets: ME-REST (PPG signals, α-EEG power and RV), NATVIEW-REST (pupil) and NKI-REST datasets (skin conductance). The length scale and kernel variance hyperparameters of the Gaussian process were set to 3 and 1, respectively. Negative shifts of the signal were included to ensure that physiological responses before the peak of the global fMRI signal were captured.

### MCCA

To estimate the joint fluctuations between the physiological and the PC1 time courses, we implemented an MCCA on the full set of signals in each dataset [^62]. Each ‘set’ was formed from time lags of a single physiological signal. Inclusion of all potential time lags out to a window size _n_ leads to potential collinearity and risks of overfitting. Instead, we implement a generalized additive distributed lag approach [^63], where time-lagged predictors for each physiological signal were generated via a linear combination of time-lagged copies of the signal with a natural cubic spline basis with three splines distributed across the time window (from 0 to 10 s; number of time points varied for each dataset due to different sampling rates). The resulting time-lagged predictor is represented by three linear-weighted versions of the original signal.

The objective of MCCA is to find a linear-weighted combination of the time-lagged copies of each signal that maximizes the pairwise correlations between all signals. MCCA was performed at the group level by group-wise temporal concatenation. The number of ‘sets’ in the MCCA analysis varied across datasets due to the differing number of physiological signals recorded across datasets. We extract the first canonical component from the MCCA algorithm, corresponding to the linear-weighted combination of all signals that produces the maximum pairwise correlation between signals. The MCCA algorithm was implemented in the cca-zoo Python package ([https://github.com/jameschapman19/cca_zoo](https://github.com/jameschapman19/cca_zoo)). Illustration of the MCCA approach used in our study is provided in Supplementary Fig. [10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#MOESM1).

Statistical significance testing of the average pairwise correlation of the first canonical component was performed using block-wise permutation of participant time courses before temporal concatenation across participants. Specifically, physiological signals were randomly shuffled across participants before temporal concatenation, effectively removing cross-signal couplings while preserving the autocorrelation structure within each signal. For example, one permutation may align signal A in participant 1 with signal B in participant 7 and so forth. For each permutation (_n_  = 1,000), the average pairwise correlation between all permuted time courses of the first canonical component was extracted to construct a null distribution.

### Event-related averages

Event-related averaging of the ME-TASK, NKI-TASK and ME-REST datasets was performed to examine the fMRI, EEG and physiological response to deep breaths, breath holds and spontaneous K-complex onsets, respectively. A group-level response function for each physiological signal was generated by averaging across all trials and participants within a window starting from onset out to ~29 s. The standard error plots for each group-level response function were generated via cluster bootstrapping, where participants were randomly resampled with replacement (_n_  = 100) before averaging.

For the ME-TASK dataset, event-related EEG power fluctuations were examined for each participant by averaging wavelet filter bank power signals (that is, time-frequency spectral power in 2–20 Hz frequencies) within a 20-s window post-breath onset across trials. Baseline log-ratio normalization (that is, decibels) was applied to the participant-averaged time courses with the time span 1 s before up until stimulus onset as the baseline. A group event-related average was constructed from averaging across event-related participant averages.

For the ME-TASK-CUE dataset, event-related averaging of physiological and EEG power time courses was conducted using the same procedure as the ME-TASK dataset. Some intertrial intervals between auditory cues were shorter for this task, on average (range, ~8–89 s), relative to the ME-TASK dataset. Trials separated by less than 30 s were excluded. In addition, trials with a nonresponse (that is, no button response) were excluded.

### Noradrenaline transport density map

The NAT density map displayed in Fig. [5d](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig5) was made available by ref. [^64] at [https://github.com/netneurolab/hansen_receptors](https://github.com/netneurolab/hansen_receptors). The NAT volumetric image was derived from an average of 77 healthy participants (as previously described [^21]) and reflects the regional binding potential of (_S_,_S_)-\[<sup>11</sup> C\]methylreboxetine, a radioligand selective for NAT. Regional binding potential was estimated by the multilinear reference tissue model 2 (MRTM2) with the occipital cortex as a reference region. The binding potential measurement is proportional to the density of available transporters for binding and is simply referred to as NAT ‘density’.

### Multi-echo modeling of T 2\* and S 0 effects

To explore potential hemodynamic effects in the global fMRI signal, we modeled _T_ <sub>2*</sub> decay rates and initial signal intensity (*S* <sub>0</sub>) signals from the ME-REST-SUPP dataset. The *T* <sub>2*</sub> and _S_ <sub>0</sub> time signals were estimated from three consecutively acquired echoes at each time point via a log-linear least squares fit to a monoexponential curve, $S\left(t\right)={S}_{0}{e}^{(\frac{-t}{{T}_2* })}$. The volume-wise log-linear least squares fit of the consecutively acquired echoes to a monoexponential curve was performed with the tedana Python package [^65] with the fit_decay_ts module.

### Cardiac RETROICOR regression of ME-ICA denoised signals

Variations in the cardiac cycle are known to induce pulsatile flow changes in cerebral arteries, causing fMRI signal fluctuations and other artifacts [^66]. Our analyses showed that variations in heart rate were associated with global fMRI fluctuations (Fig. [1b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#Fig1)), suggesting that cardiac-driven pulsatile flow changes may be prominent during global fMRI fluctuations. However, we expected artifactual fMRI signal variations from vessel pulsation and tissue deformation due to the cardiac cycle to be largely attenuated in ME-ICA denoised signals.

To demonstrate that pulsatile blood flow fluctuations of the cardiac cycle do not substantially contribute to ME-ICA denoised signals, we performed regression modeling with a Fourier series expansion of cardiac cycles acquired from PPG signals (RETROICOR regressors [^67]). Because slice-timing correction was performed before ME-ICA denoising, RETROICOR cardiac regressors estimated at each slice (to account for potential differences in slice timing) were regressed separately onto all voxel denoised signals, and the maximum explained variance (_R_ <sup>2</sup>) across slice-specific regressors was selected (Supplementary Fig. [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01945-y#MOESM1)). To demonstrate that pulsatile-driven fMRI signal fluctuations were isolated and rejected as ‘noise’ components by the ME-ICA algorithm, we also regressed RETROICOR cardiac regressors onto ‘noise’ signals constructed from rejected ICA components.
