## 1\. Introduction

The physical environment of the is changing rapidly with ongoing climate change; air temperatures are rising faster than the global average (, ), sea ice cover is declining and thinning (), freshwater content in the ocean surface layer has been increasing in the central Arctic and decreasing on the shelves (, ), heat content and are increasing due to enhanced inflow from lower latitudes and increased solar warming (, ), and circulation patterns are changing, especially connected to altered wind and sea ice drift patterns (). These changes have large impacts on the marine ecosystem (, ).

Sea ice cover immediately affects the light regime in the upper ocean: thinner ice with less snow on top, smaller and larger open water areas allow for more light to reach the marine environment, where it can be used by for primary production (e.g., , , ). The recent decrease in Arctic sea ice concentration, extent and thickness leading to a lengthening of the open-water season and a greater open-water pelagic phytoplankton habitat, has positively impacted primary productivity in the Arctic Ocean (, ). Satellite-based studies estimate a rise in Arctic-wide marine productivity by over 50% since 1998 from measurements of surface chlorophyll *a* (chl *a*) concentrations (, ). As these satellite measurements do not capture under-ice blooms or chl *a* below the surface, both sea ice and pelagic primary production has, however, likely been underestimated and trend estimates include substantial uncertainty (, , ).

However, increased productivity requires nutrients, and resupply of nutrients to the is highly dependent on , stratification and vertical mixing. There is high uncertainty regarding the future development of the Arctic , the main barrier for nutrient transfer from below into the surface mixed layer, with different patterns across the Arctic Ocean (, ). While accumulation of freshwater in the Beaufort Gyre has lead to strengthening of stratification and deepening of the halocline, increased advection of heat with Atlantic Water (AW) inflow, shoaling of the AW layer, and loss of sea ice have weakened the halocline in the Eurasian Basin (). While this could enable greater vertical nutrient flux to alleviate nutrient limitation (), report a decline in nutrient concentrations in the halocline of the Eurasian Basin, potentially as a result of enhanced upstream in the . Even further upstream, a decline in silicate and nitrate has been reported for the North Atlantic and in the Barents Sea (, , , ). However this could not be confirmed in the Western Eurasian Basin north of where found stable concentrations in the AW layer. How climate change will impact drivers of nutrient supply to the euphotic zone in the Arctic Ocean remains an important subject of investigation.

Changes in open water fraction and a more mobile and thinner sea ice cover will alter momentum transfer from the atmosphere to the ocean, potentially increasing or decreasing wind-driven surface ocean stress depending on sea ice concentration, internal stress and roughness (, , ). The region north of Svalbard is experiencing an increase in annual mean surface stress (), and if this trend continues, the additional wind-driven mixing can help to break down stratification and increase vertical nutrient fluxes (). Different modelling studies showed that this mechanism supports increased productivity along the in the Eurasian Basin and steers variability in primary and secondary production in the Barents Sea (, ). The vertical nutrient fluxes resulting from changed sea ice cover can have a major effect especially in summer and early autumn following earlier melt and later freeze-up. describe changes in Arctic phytoplankton phenology, and the combination of more light due to less or thinner sea ice and weaker stratification supporting increased nutrient supply to the surface might lead to autumn as they are more common in lower latitudes.

The warm and nutrient-rich AW enters the Arctic Ocean through the Barents Sea and along the western and northern continental slope of Svalbard (, ). In the central and eastern Barents Sea, the AW layer loses substantial amounts of heat, becomes denser and subducts below Polar Surface Water (PSW), and thus is at depth when leaving the region to the north through the St Anna Trough (). To the west and northwest of Svalbard, AW remains at or near the surface until it meets PSW north of Kvitøya (, ). This proximity to the surface keeps the northern Svalbard shelf ice free for large parts of the year, in contrast to the eastern Barents Sea. This ice-free region west and northwest of Svalbard has extended eastward as result of increased warming (, ). The AW inflow west and north of Svalbard forms a boundary current that follows the continental slope eastward (), propagating signals of upstream changes into the Central Arctic Ocean and leading to borealisation and Atlantification (, ). The AW boundary current creates an environment north of Svalbard in which advection often dominates over local processes; this applies to physical conditions (e.g., ) but also for chemical and biogeochemical properties (, ) and transport of biological material and organisms (, , ). However, larger-scale Arctic Ocean circulation impacts the region by bringing in Arctic sea ice and Polar Surface Waters (), leading to subduction of the AW layer and transition to more Arctic-like conditions impacting hydrography, nutrient availability, primary production and (, , ).

In this study, we investigate late summer and early winter conditions in hydrography, inorganic nutrients and chl *a* distributions along a transect crossing the Atlantic Water Boundary Current from the shelf to the deep basin north of Svalbard () over the period 2012–2021. In particular, we look into the connection between sea ice conditions and development of surface chl *a* concentrations during spring and summer and how they affect hydrography, nutrient availability and chl *a* distribution at the end of summer. By assessing the impact of late summer to autumn wind conditions and the role of sea ice for the interannual variability of these parameters, we evaluate whether a change in sea ice conditions would support the development of autumn blooms and thus a potential increase in primary production in the region.

## 2\. Methods

The transect is primarily a north–south meridional section situated at approximately 31°E, starting at about 200 m water depth on the north of Kvitøya and extending north into the Arctic basin to depths of $>$ 3000 m (). Repeat measurements along the transect were carried out onboard R/V Lance in September 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2017, and onboard R/V Kronprins Haakon in November 2019 and 2021 during mooring service cruises for the A-TWAIN mooring array (see, e.g., , ). Throughout this study, we refer to September as late summer and to November as early winter to reflect seasonal conditions for productivity in the region. Measurements included vertical profiles of temperature and , and water samples for inorganic nutrients (nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, silicate), chl *a* and phaeophytin ().

### 2.1. Hydrography

Temperature and salinity were measured using a Seabird 911+ conductivity–temperature–depth (CTD) sonde. The temperature and conductivity sensors were factory calibrated annually. In 2012, 2019 and 2021, additional calibration of the conductivity sensor was done against in situ salinity samples. The 2012 sampling and processing are described in ; no calibration factor was applied. In 2019 and 2021, samples were taken at the bottom of each cast and analysed at the Institute of Marine Research, Bergen, Norway, using a Guildline Portasal salinometer and IAPSO standard seawater. Deviation between conductivity sensor measurements and salinity samples was 0.011 and 0.001 mS/cm for 2019 and 2021, respectively. In 2013, the conductivity sensor was biased low and a correction of $conductivitycalibrated=1.007⋅conductivityoriginal$ was applied using deep water properties (). In 2019 and 2021, the CTD was deployed through the ship’s moon pool and any data points shallower than 14 m were discarded. For all years, CTD data from the downcast were used for analyses.

The main focus of the cruises was mooring recovery and deployment. This, together with weather and sea ice conditions, caused stations on the transect to occasionally be covered multiple times, not in order by latitude or with time gaps, and the northward extent of the transect varied between years. To construct consistent, near-synoptic (whenever possible) sections for analysis, station data were included depending on alignment with the main transect, concurrent water sampling for nutrients, and shortest possible time difference between casts. In particular, stations that were taken close to but not on the main transect as part of additional transects or in connection with mooring operations (see e.g. station maps in , ) were not used here. Single stations with nutrient samples were occasionally not included in the hydrographic section plots and analyses when they disrupted an otherwise near-synoptic coverage of the transect, which mainly was the case when water samples were taken during a repeat station before or after the main transect was covered. CTD data were converted and processed using combination of Seabird Seasoft software and Matlab routines to remove outliers and loops, and binned to 1 dbar bins. We used the GSW Oceanographic Toolbox of TEOS-10 () to derive conservative temperature $T$, absolute salinity *SA*, potential density anomaly $σθ$, and buoyancy frequency $N2$ from the CTD profiles. In a stably , $N2$ is positive and a higher $N2$ indicates stronger stratification. We therefore use the maximum in $N2$ as indicator of the depth of the and thus the bottom of the mixed layer.

shows the definitions that were used, following and . The original definitions were based on potential temperature ($θ$), practical salinity ($S$) and potential density anomaly based on $θ$ and $S$. We applied the previously used limits to conservative temperature, absolute salinity and potential density anomaly. Comparison of the corresponding variables and the resulting water mass distinctions show that differences are small ($T$: $θ$ +(−0.006–0.012), *SA*: $S$ +(0.153–0.168), $σ0$: $σθ,S,0$ +(0.001–0.0045)), and we consider them negligible for this study.

We divided the transect into “shelf” (shallower than 265 m), “slope” (between 265 and 1800 m), and “deep basin” (deeper than 1800 m) to distinguish between different regions relative to bottom depth. Averages of temperature and salinity (and nutrients, see below) for the different regions or by water mass were calculated using all available data points, regardless of the different transect length in the different years. While coverage over the deep basin varied considerably, properties within water masses and in the deep part of the transect were rather uniform (except for the AW layer). Sensitivity tests with shortened transects for 2012 and 2013 for hydrography and nutrients show that general results do not change, but patterns related to the AW inflow over the shelf and slope are reinforced when deep basin stations are removed.

### 2.2. Inorganic nutrients: Nitrate + nitrite, phosphate, silicate

Water samples for nutrient analysis were collected from Niskin bottles mounted on the CTD rosette and closed on the upcast at selected stations (, ) at standard depths of 5 (near surface), 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300 and 500 m and near bottom with additional samples at 40, 60, 125 and/or 150 m in some years and depending on bottom depth. The uppermost water samples in 2019 and 2021 were taken at 10 m to avoid the impact of the moon pool.

In all years except 2021, subsamples for determination of nitrate, nitrite (here, we use the sum of nitrate and nitrite, henceforth referred to as nitrate), (referred to as silicate) and phosphate were collected in acid-washed tubes and frozen at −20 °C for analysis on land after the cruise. Three parallel subsamples from each sample were analysed at UiT by standard seawater methods using a Flow Solution IV analyser from O. I. Analytical, . In 2021, samples were collected in 25 mL polyethylene vials, added chloroform (200 $μ$ L) and stored at 4 °C until analysis at IMR Bergen. The analysis was done using a spectrophotometric method (Skalar, Netherlands) following the procedure described in detail in . In all years, values were calibrated against reference seawater from Ocean Scientific International Ltd., UK. Detection limits were as follows: nitrate: 0.5 $μM$; nitrite: 0.5 $μM$; phosphate: 0.06 $μM$; and silicate: 0.7 $μM$. In 2013, samples from one station at 81.72 $°N$ resulted in anomalously low nitrate and silicate values. A corresponding signal could not be found in hydrography or chl *a* and phaeophytin values; we therefore suspect contamination or analytical error of the nutrient samples and excluded this station from the following analyses.

To determine the depth to which nutrients were depleted in the surface layer, the depth of the nitracline was defined as the shallowest depth at which the vertical gradient in nitrate concentration became larger than 0.1 $μM$ m <sup>−1</sup>. In 2019, only two stations along the transect had a vertical gradient $>$ 0.1 $μM$ m <sup>−1</sup> and no nitracline could be determined at the other stations, and for 2021, none of the stations displayed a distinct nitracline.

Nitrate to phosphate (N/P), nitrate to silicate (N/Si) and silicate to nitrate (Si/N) ratios were determined for each cruise and each nutrient sampling station by the slope of the linear regression between nitrate and phosphate, and silicate and nitrate, respectively, for all relevant samples.

### 2.3. Chlorophyll a and phaeophytin

Samples for chl *a* and phaeopigments were collected for calibration of the CTD-mounted fluorescence sensor as well as to complement nutrient samples for biological conditions. Triplicate samples of 0.2–0.5 L were filtered through $0.7μm$ GF/F filters (total chl *a* and phaeopigments) and $10μm$ filters (chl *a* and phaeopigments $>10μm$), extracted in 100% methanol for minimum 12 h at 4 °C and in darkness. The samples were analysed onboard, or filters were frozen at −20 °C and analysed in the lab at UiT. After homogenisation, fluorescence was measured before and after acidification with two drops of 5% HCl using a Turner AU-10 fluorometer. Chl *a* and phaeopigment concentrations were calculated based on equations from . The fluorometer was calibrated using a dilution series of pure chl *a* (analytical standard).

To calibrate the fluorescence sensor mounted on the CTD, fluorescence values were extracted for each profile and depth where a chl *a* sample was taken. A linear regression model was then derived by fitting the extracted fluorescence to the corresponding measured chl *a* concentration (regression statistically significant at $p<0.005$ in all years) and used to calibrate the CTD fluorescence profiles. For 2021, no chl *a* concentration data from seawater samples were available from our cruise or the cruises right before or after using the same fluorometer. However, CTD fluorescence was very low and near the noise level of the sensor, indicating very low winter chl *a* concentrations, and we would not expect any significant changes from calibration against water samples.

### 2.4. Satellite and reanalysis data

Daily sea ice concentration data derived from AMSR-2 was downloaded from the Institute of Environmental Physics, University of Bremen, Germany (), available at [https://seaice.uni-bremen.de/sea-ice-concentration-amsr-eamsr2/](https://seaice.uni-bremen.de/sea-ice-concentration-amsr-eamsr2/). Daily, satellite-sensed, near-surface chlorophyll *a* ($chlsat$) concentration was derived from open access Aqua data products (Level 3 Standard Mapped Image (SMI), chlorophyll *a*, 9 km resolution; ), obtained from [http://oceandata.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov](http://oceandata.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/), accessed on 01.07.2019 for 2012–2017 data and on 01.06.2022 for 2018–2021. To distinguish between chl *a* from water samples, CTD fluorescence and satellite, we will refer to them as chl *a*, $chlCTD$ and $chlsat$, respectively, throughout the manuscript.

To examine the temporal development of the sea ice cover and $chlsat$ concentrations in the region of our transect, we defined an area covering the latitudinal extent of the transect and including the upstream region with the boundaries 80.5–82.5 $°N$, 15–35 $°E$ to calculate daily averages. This area allows for sufficient satellite data coverage for $chlsat$ even in periods with sea ice cover while avoiding inclusion of signals due to different circulation patterns further west. See Figure S1 for spatial distribution of data availability per year. Sensitivity test with different box sizes (not shown) confirm that results are stable and do not change significantly with smaller or larger boxes (while still avoiding reaching into the Fram Strait outflow). However, in years with extensive ice cover throughout the summer and thus limited satellite observation, the $chlsat$ time series likely underestimates surface chlorophyll concentrations. From approximately mid-September to mid-March, low sun elevation angle and/or lack of sunlight prevent $chlsat$ measurements in our study region, restricting possible detection of surface chlorophyll during autumn.

Hourly data for surface wind, air temperature, net shortwave and and surface humidity from reanalysis were accessed and downloaded from the Copernicus Climate Change Service Climate Data Store on 25 and 27 July 2023 (, ).

## 3\. Results

### 3.1. Hydrography

The temperature and salinity transects at 31°E in both September (2012, 2013, 2015, and 2017) and November (2019 and 2021) reflect the general structure across the Atlantic Water Boundary Current from the shelf to the deep basin north of with a fresh surface layer above AW and intermediate and deep (, ; , , S2). The characteristics of the surface layer vary between years and along the transect. On average, the surface layer (PSW and warm PSW), defined as the layer with $σ0<27.7$ (), is fresher ($<$ 35 g kg <sup>−1</sup>) and colder ($<$ 3 °C) than the underlying AW. Using the definition in , there often is a transition layer from surface waters to AW, where heat loss and interaction between the water masses creates cooler and slightly fresher modified AW (MAW). The dominant AW with high $T$ (2–5 °C) and high *SA* ($>$ 34.9 g kg <sup>−1</sup>) extends from $<$ 50 m to the bottom over the shelf and upper , i.e. the core of the AW inflow, and from $>50$ m to approximately 500 to 600 m in the deeper parts of the transect. The warmest water in the AW layer is generally located above the slope with $T>$ 4 °C in both late summer (2012–2017) and early winter (2019 and 2021). In late summer, maximum salinity is $>$ 35.21 g kg <sup>−1</sup>, whereas in early winter, *SA* reaches only 35.15 g kg <sup>−1</sup>. Below the AW layer, there is a transition layer (deep MAW) to Intermediate Water (IW), which is considerably colder than AW, and then Deep Water (DW). Note that in 2017, no Deep Water was captured as CTD casts did not extend deep enough (). Average hydrographic properties of each water mass by year are given in Table S1. For this study, we will focus on the water layers from AW upwards.

There is considerable interannual variability in the surface and AW layer properties. In 2012, warm PSW (wPSW) extended over almost the entire transect to approximately 81.95 $°N$, and reaching 25 m depth furthest north and $∼$ 50 m on the shelf and upper slope. Below that, PSW was present from the deeper part of the slope northwards and down to a depth of approx. 70 m. AW occupied between 400 to 350 m of the water column from shelf/slope to the deep basin with the warmest AW located above the upper slope (maximum $T=4.1°C$). In 2013, wPSW was also present over the entire transect but with lower temperatures than in 2012 over the deeper part, and with strong influence of AW over the shelf and slope with high temperatures (up to $4.6°C$) and salinities (34.87 g kg <sup>−1</sup>) reaching all the way to the surface. A colder, saltier and deeper (to around 200 m) PSW is connected to an anomalously cold AW layer in 2013 where temperatures rarely reached more than 2.5 °C in the deeper part of the transect. Due to the generally lower temperatures, less of the water column was occupied by AW and a larger part by MAW, both above and below the AW layer, than in 2012. In 2015, warm water reached to the surface above the slope similar to 2013, although with distinctly lower salinities. At the shallowest shelf station, the warm layer was capped off by colder and fresher surface water. In the deep part of the transect, PSW extended to similar depth as in 2012 but is colder and fresher at the surface ($T$ near freezing point, $SA<31.5$ g kg <sup>−1</sup>). The AW has similar properties above the slope as in 2012, but becomes fresher and colder in the deep basin and occupies a thinner layer (120–430 m depth at the northernmost end of the transect). 2017 stands out with different conditions in the surface layer compared to the previous years. Over the entire transect including the shelf and slope, a cold and fresh PSW layer separated the AW from the surface and no wPSW was present. The AW layer was warmer than in 2012–2015 and in the deep basin occupied a similar depth range as in 2012 (80–500 m depth). In 2017, on the upper slope were higher than in 2012–2015 with *SA* $slope=35.17$ g kg <sup>−1</sup>.

Interannual variability in early winter conditions was similarly large as in late summer. The two transects conducted in November 2019 and 2021 show very different patterns both in surface layer properties and AW properties. 2019 was characterised by a very cold (surface temperatures at freezing point over most of the transect) but saline surface layer compared to late summer conditions ($SA>34.5$ g kg <sup>−1</sup>). The core of the AW inflow, characterised by high temperatures and salinities (and a maximum in in the AW layer; ) over the shelf and upper slope was warm compared to the late summer transects in 2012–2017 and the early winter transect of 2021 whereas the AW layer towards the deeper part of the transect was rather cold. The AW salinity was lower than in the late summer transects. The dip in temperature and salinity at approximately 81.55 $°N$ in is due to non-synoptic coverage of the transect, i.e., an extended time gap between two adjacent stations in 2019 that could have allowed for, e.g., a reversal in . In 2021, transect coverage into the deep basin was limited. However, the AW layer extends to the surface along most of the transect, and the surface layer resembles more modified AW than wPSW due to its high salinity (, ). Only small pockets of slightly colder and fresher SW with $T$ reaching 0 °C and minimum *SA* at 34.46 g kg <sup>−1</sup> exist over the deeper part of the transect. The AW core appears to be situated both deeper in the water column and further north above greater water depth than in November 2019 and than in any of the September transects. $T$ and *SA* in the AW layer in 2021 are comparable to 2019, i.e. overall similar temperatures as in the other years, but slightly lower salinity.

The differences in hydrography between years and seasons is also reflected in the strength of stratification, expressed here by the buoyancy frequency $N2$ (). In general, maximum $N2$ is higher and shallower in the late summer transects (2012–2017) than in early winter (2019 and 2021). The transects extending furthest north (2012 and 2013) experience low maximum $N2$ over the shelf and upper slope, suggesting weak stratification, and shoaling of the maximum $N2$ from the deeper part of the slope to the deep basin. Strongest late summer stratification is observed in 2015, located highest in the water column, closely followed by 2017 when $N2$ was high above the shelf and slope due to the extensive PSW layer. The early winter transect in 2019 shows a clear $N2$ maximum throughout the transect, though weaker and shallower than in the late summer transects, whereas in 2021, $N2$ is low throughout the water column above the shelf and slope and only reaches a clearer maximum at the deepest stations.

### 3.2. Nutrient distributions

In general, nitrate, phosphate and silicate concentrations in late summer (2012–2017) were low in the surface layer, increasing with depth to around 75–100 m, below which concentrations remained stably high (, Table S2). Nitrate and phosphate were low at the surface ($[NO3]<2μM$, $[PO4]<0.25μM$ to 20 m depth) in all late summer transects, whereas surface silicate concentrations were more variable ($0.8–2.5μM$ in the upper 20 m). Along the transect, highest concentrations of all nutrients occurred in the near-bottom samples over the continental slope and in the deep basin (maximum $[NO3]$, $[PO4]$, and $[SiOH4]$ of $>$ 12.96, 0.95 and 10.5 $μM$, respectively, across all years and stations). The long transects in 2012 and 2013 indicate that nitrate concentrations throughout the water column decreased with latitude. The early winter transects in 2019 and 2021 show two very different scenarios, but in both years, surface nutrient concentrations were considerably higher than in the late summer years whereas concentrations below the mixed layer were comparable (Table S2).

As with the hydrography, nutrient concentrations varied between years, both in absolute numbers and distribution (, , S3). In 2012, we observed the deepest nitracline of all years at around 30 m (). Nitrate concentrations above the nitracline were very low in 2012 ($[NO3]<0.84μM$), particularly over the slope and deep basin. However, at the nitracline and directly below, concentrations were high, especially over the slope, which might be related to the strong signal of the AW inflow. The N/P ratio over the shelf and slope was lowest for all years in 2012 while the Si/N ratio was comparatively high; both likely due to the very low surface nitrate concentrations, and the elevated phosphate and silicate concentrations below the nitracline (). In 2013, the nitracline was generally shallower than in 2012 but also more variable along the transect. Nitrate concentrations were considerably higher above the nitracline along the entire transect and below the nitracline over the slope and the deep basin. While the AW inflow promoted a local temperature maximum and elevated salinity reaching to the surface over the slope (), this was not reflected in higher phosphate concentrations there, and only partially so for silicate concentrations. On the contrary, phosphate concentrations in AW-influenced layers were lower over the shelf and slope than in the deep basin. The resulting overall N/P ratios were higher in 2013 than in 2012 whereas Si/N was lower (). However, looking in more detail at the ratios by latitude, especially the N/P ratios vary considerably along the transect, with high ratios over the shelf and slope and lower N/P ratios in the deep basin.

The nutrient transect in 2015 was the shortest of late summer transects. It crosses the core of the AW inflow but provides only limited information in the deep basin. Nutrient concentrations and nitracline depth are less variable than in the previous years. None of the nutrient distributions reflect the signal of the AW inflow over the slope. Instead, concentrations are evenly distributed along the entire transect and low at depth compared to the other late summer measurements. In 2017, both nutrient concentrations and distributions were similar again to 2012 and 2013, with low concentrations in the surface layer and high values at depth. The nitracline was rather shallow, particularly over the shelf, and the surface layer was not as clearly depleted as in 2012 and 2013. The highest concentrations are observed at depth over the deeper part of the slope and the deep basin instead of in the AW inflow core, which is in contrast to 2012 and 2013. N/P ratios are rather low and on similar levels as in 2015, whereas the Si/N ratios are among the highest of all years due to the relatively high silicate concentrations throughout the water column. Si/N uptake ratios around 0.5 by late summer might indicate nitrate uptake by the non-silicate haptophyte *Phaeocystis pouchetii* (, ) after which silicate uptake can occur as diatom blooms develop during the seasonal transitions as found in the (, ).

The winter transects in 2019 and 2021 differ from the late summer transect in 2012–2017 most clearly in the surface mixed layer nutrient concentrations (, S3, Table S2). In 2019, this surface layer was still fairly pronounced with low nutrient concentrations, but had started and nitrate and phosphate concentrations in the PSW and wPSW were $>$ 5.6 $μM$ and $>$ 0.5 $μM$, respectively. Near-surface silicate concentrations, however, were higher in 2017. The vertical gradient in nitrate concentration was eroded to the point that a nitracline according to the definition outlined in Section could only be determined at two stations (the one furthest south and furthest north, with 10 and 20 m, respectively). Below the surface mixed layer, concentrations were on similar levels as the previous years, and a clear signal of the AW inflow was lacking in the latitudinal nutrient distributions despite the presence of an AW inflow signature in the hydrographic properties (). Although sampled slightly earlier in November, the 2021 surface nutrient concentrations (PSW and wPSW) were even higher, and the vertical gradient was eroded further than in 2019. Concentrations at depth are comparable to the previous early winter transect in 2019. The only exceptions were nitrate concentrations on the shelf and upper slope that were higher than in 2019. Si/N was markedly higher in 2021 compared to 2019. This increase indicates that an additional source might have contributed silicate to the water column north of Svalbard.

### 3.3. Chl a and phaeophytin distributions

In all late summer transects, chl *a* was primarily found in the surface layer above 50 m (, and S4). Below that, both bottle and CTD fluorescence data showed little to no chl *a*. Patterns were similar for total and size-fractionated ($>$ 10 $μm$) chl *a* and phaeophytin concentrations. Size-fractionated chl *a* indicated higher fractions of larger phytoplankton cells below the mixed layer in most years. Phaeophytin is the degraded product of chl *a*, and the ratio $[phaeophytin]/[phaeophytin+chla]$ indicates how fresh the algal material is, with a higher phaeophytin to chl *a* ratio indicating a higher degree of degradation (e.g., , and references therein). Degradation can result from microbial degradation or zooplankton grazing. Total phaeophytin to chl *a* ratios were generally lower in the mixed layer and elevated below, whereas the size-fractionated phaeophytin to chl *a* ratios (not shown) were more variable, both between years and along the transect.

In 2012, $chlCTD$ indicated a deep chl *a* maximum with highest concentrations at the bottom of the . In the bottle samples this pattern is not quite as clear with more even distribution of chl *a* reaching up to 0.43 mg m <sup>−3</sup> throughout the surface mixed layer and along the transect, possibly because of the bottle sample depths not matching the depths of the deep chl *a* maximum. Surface size-fractionated chl *a* ($>$ 10 $μm$) was elevated above the shelf and slope relative to the deep basin. Ratios between size-fractionated chl *a* and total chl *a* indicate a higher fraction of large phytoplankton below the mixed layer and in the deep basin. Total phaeophytin concentrations are higher over shelf and slope than over the deep basin, whereas the pattern is opposite for size-fractionated phaeophytin ($>$ 10 $μm$). Phaeophytin to chl *a* ratios are higher below the mixed layer for total concentrations, but not for the $>$ 10 $μm$ size fraction. In 2013, chl *a* concentrations were second highest after those concentrations in 2017 with a marked maximum from the surface to the bottom of the mixed layer above the shelf and upper slope (up to 0.85 mg m <sup>−3</sup>). This maximum was also present in total phaeophytin, and size-fractionated chl *a* and phaeophytin. In contrast to 2012, most of the chl *a* was confined to the layer above the pycnocline, and only in the deeper part of the transect, a deep chl *a* maximum had formed at the bottom of the pycnocline.

2015 stood out with the lowest chl *a* concentrations of the four years of late summer observations ($<$ 0.28 mg m <sup>−3</sup>) and low size-fractionated chl *a* off the shelf. Total phaeophytin concentrations, however, were comparable to 2012, and size-fractionated phaeophytin to chl *a* ratios were the highest of all years, especially below the mixed layer. The phaeophytin to chl *a* ratio was clearly elevated above the shelf and decreased towards the north, similarly to the distribution observed in 2017, when this pattern extend also below the pycnocline. In 2017, the highest concentrations of total and size-fractionated chl *a* and phaeophytin of all years were measured. Chl *a* showed a local maximum over the slope at the bottom of the mixed layer. For the other variables, concentrations were high throughout the surface mixed layer. Ratios of size-fractionated chl *a* and phaeophytin (total and size-fractionated) were elevated compared to the other years.

As expected, $chlCTD$ in the early winter transects 2019 and 2021 (, ) was low, indicating that there were very low concentrations of chl *a* in the water column in November. Water samples in 2019 showed low concentrations of phaeophytin and chl *a*, and a high phaeophytin to chl *a* ratio, suggesting a high degree of degradation and little fresh algal material. Lack of sunlight prohibits local primary production at this time of year, and the degraded material might have been advected into the region with the AW inflow.

## 4\. Discussion

The transects showed large interannual variability, both in late summer and early winter, and patterns differed for the different parameters. In 2012 and 2013, the hydrographic structure was similar with wPSW at the surface above cold PSW and warm MAW and AW, but nutrient and chl *a* concentrations and distribution varied with low surface-layer nutrient concentrations and a pronounced deep chl *a* maximum in 2012 compared to a shallower, more variable nitracline, highly variable nutrient ratios along the transect and higher surface chl *a* above shelf and slope in 2013. The late summers in 2015 and 2017 were characterised by cold PSW at the surface and a shallow mixed layer, however, in 2015 a sub-surface layer of wPSW was present whereas in 2017, this layer was absent. Nutrient concentrations in the surface layers were similar in both years, but deep concentrations differed considerably with 2017 being more similar to 2012 and 2013. The greatest differences existed, however, in the chl *a* distributions where values were very low in 2015 and high in the pycnocline in 2017. The early winter years 2019 and 2021 were very different in all parameters apart from the very low $chlCTD$ throughout the water column. 2019 was characterised by the presence of a pronounced cold and fresh surface layer with low nutrient concentrations, whereas stratification was weak in 2021 and warm, nutrient-rich AW extended to the surface.

In the following sections, we will discuss potential drivers for the observed differences between the years, in particular the effect of wind-driven mixing and its dependence on the underlying hydrography, and the role of sea ice in shaping upper ocean conditions and chlorophyll distribution at the surface and in the water column. Finally, we speculate on implications of our results for potential future development of autumn blooms in the study region north of Svalbard.

### 4.1. Interannual variability and potential for wind-driven mixing in autumn

The different late summer conditions provide different starting points for breakdown of stratification during autumn and upward mixing of nutrients; the early winter transects reflect the results of this autumn mixing. We tested the potential impact of wind in driving this process in our survey years by calculating the theoretical Ekman depth $DE$ as indicator for how deep wind-driven mixing could reach (in the absence of strong stratification): (1) $DE=πρaCd2ρWΩα1sin(θ)W$ with $ρa=$ density of air (1.3 g m <sup>−3</sup>), $Cd=$ drag coefficient (taken as $1.4×10−4$), $ρW=$ density of water (1026 g m <sup>−3</sup>), $Ω=$ rotation rate of the Earth, $θ=$ latitude (81.5 $°N$), $α=$ empirical constant (0.0127) and $W=$; see, e.g., . While the theoretical Ekman depth does not equate to the actual wind-driven mixing depth, especially in the presence of sea ice (see, e.g., ), it is easier to relate to the than wind speed itself. Additionally, we apply the one-dimensional bulk mixed layer Price–Weller–Pinkel model (PWP; ) with modifications to allow for impact of sea ice. A detailed description of the modified model is given in and . We used hourly reanalysis data (, ) for the period 15September to 1December for each of the years that we have hydrographic observations for, as forcing data. Two experiments were run to investigate 1. the impact of each year’s wind field and atmospheric conditions on the respective water column structure (years with late summer hydrography measurements only; initiated from the CTD profile in the AW inflow core, roughly above the 800 m isobath, taken in the respective year); and 2. the impact of each year’s wind field on the same hydrography (all years; initiated from the 2017 CTD profile in the AW inflow core). Wind conditions, theoretical Ekman depth, and model results (modelled mixed layer depth and $N2$) are shown in .

Wind direction and speed from late summer to early winter were highly variable between years. While for example southerly winds with moderate wind speed dominated in 2012, 2021 experienced stronger northerly winds. The theoretical Ekman depth is only depending on the wind speed, and years with higher wind speeds (2013, 2017, 2021) displayed greater Ekman depths than years with low wind speeds (2012, 2015, 2019). If we consider a great Ekman depth to be an indicator for a larger potential for wind-driven mixing and thus greater deepening of the mixed layer, especially the difference between the early winter years corresponds well with the observed differences in mixed layer depth and strength of stratification in 2019 and 2021, where 2021 was considerably weaker stratified (). The results from the modified PWP confirm this pattern: when initiated from the same hydrographic profile, wind and atmospheric conditions in 2021 promote a greater deepening of the mixed layer from mid-September to early December than in 2019. However, the model results also demonstrate the importance of air temperature and radiative fluxes, and initial conditions, i.e., the late summer hydrography. In 2015, wind speeds are relatively high in late September and early October, but mixed layer depth increases rapidly also during the calmer period in late October and early November. In 2017 by contrast, wind speeds are high throughout November, but mixed layer depth remains rather stable. 2012 and 2013 show little and high changes in mixed layer depth, respectively, when initiated from the CTD profile measured in those years, but considerably larger versus smaller changes, respectively, when starting from the same profile.

discuss extensively the connection (or lack thereof) between mixed layer depth and wind speed in the . They suggest that the relationship is weak; correlations are significant only for open water conditions, and the relationship is strongly affected by presence of sea ice (see also , ). Transfer of momentum from atmosphere to ocean through sea ice is highly complex, however. While suggested that there might be an optimum sea ice concentration for maximum momentum transfer, they followed this up in and showed that such as surface and bottom roughness and internal strength and form drag alter the momentum transfer. If we add the impact of snow, e.g., by smoothing the sea ice surface and altering light transfer, implications for primary production become even more complicated.

### 4.2. Sea ice conditions and surface chl a concentrations in the study region and upstream

While we do not have detailed information or time series data of sea ice characteristics such as thickness and roughness along our transects, we can investigate the general development of sea ice coverage in our study region using satellite-derived ice concentration data. Satellite-based observations allow us to put our measurements in a larger spatial and temporal context, linking our late summer and early winter measurements to seasonal sea ice and spring bloom dynamics. Sea ice modulates heat, momentum and gas exchange between ocean and atmosphere (, , , ), limits light availability for primary producers in the upper ocean (, ), and provides biological material (ice algae, organic matter, sediments) to seed blooms at the ice edge and in the (, ). To take into account the impact of the AW inflow regarding of nutrients and phytoplankton (also consuming nutrients upstream along the AW inflow) (, ), we include the region to the west of our transect in our analyses of sea ice conditions and $chlsat$ distribution throughout the year leading up to the ship campaigns.

As sea ice impacts primary productivity directly by limiting light in the upper ocean, we take a closer look into the development of sea ice concentration in the region prior to the time of sampling in late summer. Light can efficiently enter the upper ocean through leads in drift ice (), we therefore choose a threshold of 50% ice concentration to assess whether or not a location can be considered “ice-free” with respect to availability of “sufficient” light. While this threshold is chosen rather arbitrarily, it aims to take into account the effects of, e.g., opening up of the ice pack, snow melt, and development of melt ponds during spring and summer on the pelagic light regime and thus primary production (, ). Our analyses are not sensitive to the exact number, but a value of 50% ensured that we captured approximately the onset of ice retreat instead of a short-term decrease as could be the case with a higher threshold. shows average sea ice concentrations for the 60-day period prior to 15September, approximately the date of nutrient sampling for the late summer campaigns. Sea ice concentration was highly variable throughout the 2012–2021 period. In most years, ice concentrations on the shelf were $<$ 50% for about two months prior to 15September (Supplementary Figure S5), whereas the deep part of the transect was ice-free for less than a month. The years 2014 and 2019 stand out with near complete ice coverage throughout the entire year. Only a small region over the shelf in the southwestern corner of our box had sea ice concentration below 50% in the week prior to 15September. In 2018, and to a lesser degree in 2016, the opposite occurred with very little to no ice over the entire shelf and slope and into the deep basin over the entire year.

The $chlsat$ observations give an indication of the seasonal change of phytoplankton concentrations and bloom development even though they likely underestimate phytoplankton biomass due to presence of sea ice, lack of detection of under-ice blooms and vertical extent of phytoplankton distribution such as subsurface chl *a* maximum (, , ). shows time series of satellite-derived average sea ice and $chlsat$ concentrations in a box north of Svalbard () as well as measured chl *a* from the bottle samples. Spikes in $chlsat$ occur in general after a drop of sea ice concentrations, likely linked to the sudden change in ice regime and potential seeding of the pelagic bloom by (). However, there is large variability regarding the magnitude of both the sea ice reduction and the subsequent $chlsat$ spike. Years with an extensive and persistent ice cover (2014, 2017, 2019, 2020) are often characterised by low $chlsat$ concentrations, especially when sea ice retreated late or only partially, as in 2014 and 2019 (Figure S5). Even when the pack ice is slightly less dense (2015, 2021), $chlsat$ concentrations remain relatively low. By contrast, the slightly earlier retreat in 2017 is followed by a delayed rise in $chlsat$, opposing previous observations where earlier ice melt would result in an earlier, meltwater-induced spring bloom (e.g., ). We could speculate that the relatively slow ice retreat in 2017 failed to produce a distinct layer at first (potentially mixed or advected away), and a longer period of meltwater accumulation was necessary to provide sufficient stratification. However, this delay could also be an artefact of the satellite measurements: due to the extensive ice cover, satellite data points are limited (Figure S1) and an earlier bloom development, potentially under sea ice or in leads, might have been missed. In 2020, the drop in ice concentrations occurred at a similar time as in 2017 but no bloom is observed. This could be connected to the extensive sea ice cover throughout the winter before which might have limited autumn and winter mixing, also indicated by lower nutrient concentrations in the surface layer and stronger stratification observed in November 2019 compared to the other early winter cruise in November 2021 (, ). By contrast, years with very low ice coverage (2016, 2018) experience high $chlsat$ levels already from early spring and, in the case of 2018 when the ice edge was located far north (), throughout summer.

Satellite data only capture the surface, whereas our bottle data reveal chl *a* below the surface and provide information on the phase of the bloom and degradation state of the phytoplankton material (, S4). Especially in 2012 and 2017, the chl *a* maximum was at or just below the pycnocline and strongest over the deeper part of the transect while 2013 has a pronounced maximum in the near-surface over the slope. Phaeophytin proportions were high in all years, with the highest values observed in AW-derived water masses and lowest in surface waters. investigated bloom dynamics in the Pacific Arctic using satellite- and water sample-derived chl *a* and set a phaeophytin proportion threshold of 28% to characterise a mature bloom. Our samples indicate significantly higher proportions ($>$ 44 $%$ in the upper 10 m and 45% in the combined PSW and wPSW), suggesting a senescent bloom in agreement with the $chlsat$ time series. Surface nutrient concentrations, vertical distribution of chl *a* and size-fractionated chl *a* point to bloom to post-bloom conditions in early September according to the categorisation by . further found that years with more sea ice (years with high sea ice concentrations and late breakup) were associated with larger phaeophytin proportion in mid-summer (July) than low sea ice years. However, they also point out large interannual variability and the importance of other factors such as stratification and nutrient availability. While our ship-borne dataset of chl *a* and phaophytin is limited to four years of observations collected in late summer (though similar timing relative to sea ice breakup) and one year in early winter, we see similar patterns: 2012 and 2013 are years with relatively low sea ice concentrations, early breakup and low phaeophytin proportions compared to 2015 and 2017. Interestingly, 2015 stands out with the highest proportion of phaeophytin both at the surface and throughout the water column (except in PSW), following very high ice concentrations during the autumn and early winter 2014–2015, and matching the high proportions observed on the Pacific side with very different ().

and found drawdown of nitrate and bloom initiation to occur at the same time at two long-term moorings deployed in the AW inflow north of Svalbard where one was deployed further west in year-round open water and the other further east experiencing seasonal sea ice cover. They suggested that deeper mixing in ice-free open-water conditions leads to reduced light for algal growth as algae are mixed down to greater depth, and delays the onset of the bloom to the time when sea ice melt facilitates stratification and a shallower mixed layer, enabling phytoplankton growth at the eastern mooring. Our data reflect the connection between sea ice extent, concentrations and timing of retreat and onset of the spring bloom. Late onset in open water in 2018 (as also observed by , ) was probably due to lack of stratification, while late onset in 2017 with earlier ice melt may be due to under-ice blooms. However, to detect and confirm the role of under-ice blooms and timing of nutrient drawdown, time series observations under the sea ice are required, e.g., by moored nitrate sensors.

### 4.3. Impact of sea ice variability on surface layer properties and stratification

A more indirect impact of sea ice on primary productivity and thus phytoplankton concentrations is the effect on hydrography and stratification. A close ice pack hinders wind-driven mixing whereas thinner and more mobile drift ice can increase drag and thus momentum transfer (). Mixing can then lead to weakening of stratification, deepening of the surface mixed layer, and transport of nutrients to the surface (). Light limitation by dense pack ice also inhibits heat transfer into the surface ocean and thermal stratification. On the other hand, sea ice formation and melt will affect the surface layer by increasing and decreasing salinity, respectively. A fresh melt layer can efficiently cap off the layer below from the surface, thus limiting nutrient flux to the surface layer and restricting primary production to the potentially deeper part of the euphotic layer below. At the same time, the transect lies in a highly advective region and thus also reflects processes taking place upstream, both regarding advected water masses and sea ice drift (, , ), and ice-ocean processes that influence carbon and nutrient cycling along the AW inflow (, ).

The autumn and winter seasons 2014–2015 and 2019–2020 were characterised by extensive sea ice cover also throughout the low-ice season (August–January). note that the high sea ice concentration anomalies were connected to large import of sea ice from the central Arctic, due to an eastward deflection of the Transpolar Drift towards our study region. When this sea ice meets the AW north of Svalbard, the upward heat flux leads to melt and input of cold and fresh surface water, thus increasing stratification and reducing vertical exchange (, ) and potentially explaining the strong stratification in November 2019 compared to November 2021.

To look closer into the persistence of the sea ice cover from winter until late summer to investigate the potential impact of enhanced or reduced momentum transfer on stratification and thus potential vertical flux, we define the date of summer retreat by the last day of ice concentrations above 80% before 15September of the years with hydrographic observations. Then, 2012 and 2013 appear similar with retreat around the month shift June–July; 2015, 2017 and 2021 experience slightly later retreat in late July or early August; and 2019 stands out with ice concentrations above 80% until early September. However, in 2012, average ice concentrations were less often above 90% than in 2013, both temporally and spatially, and the duration of ice coverage with concentration $>$ 80% was only just over 50 days compared to 80 days in 2013. Along with the different properties of the AW inflow (narrower and warmer core but colder from the deeper part of the slope northward) and colder and thicker PSW in 2013, this might have contributed to enhanced warming of the surface layer, greater momentum transfer from atmosphere to ocean through wind-driven mixing, and a deeper mixed layer in 2012. In 2015 and 2017, sea ice concentrations were above 80% for 139 and 140 days, respectively, but the ice pack was denser in 2017 with 118 days of concentrations $>$ 90% (in 2015: 84 days). While the mixed layer depth appears similar in both years over the deeper part of the transect, the cold and fresh surface layer is far more pronounced and extending onto the shelf in 2017. This supports the sea ice budget analyses by who show that in 2017, a large amount of sea ice was lost in the area, and our result indicates that much of this ice was melted, leading to strong stratification over the entire transect.

### 4.4. Connecting physics and biology and role of regional versus large-scale processes

The four years with late summer observations of hydrography, nutrient and chl *a* concentrations are characterised by similar levels of $chlsat$ concentrations integrated over the summer (calculated as the time integral of the $chlsat$ time series shown in per year) and similar timing of sea ice retreat and thus ice-free period prior to sampling. However, the years differ considerably regarding winter-to-summer sea ice coverage, stratification, bloom development and in situ chl *a* and phaeophytin levels, and nutrient concentrations (especially below the nitracline) and ratios.

While we do not have observations of the phytoplankton community along our transects, nutrient ratios might give an indication of dominant species as well as resupply processes. suggested idealised ratios for carbon to nitrate to phosphate (C:N:P) of 106:16:1 in marine organisms, and modified these for diatoms to include silicate (C:Si:N:P = 106:15:16:1). The idealised ratios are included in . Averaged across the entire transects, our late summer N/P ratios in all years were below Redfield values, whereas winter ratios were close to or slightly above the of N/P = 16. Si/N ratios were below the Redfield–Brzezinski ratio (Si/N = 0.94) in all years, summer and winter. The low summer nutrient ratios especially in 2012, 2015 and 2017 are indicative of diatom production under nutrient-replete conditions (). The spring blooms in our region are typically dominated by diatoms or *Phaeocystis pouchetii*, which is an important non-silicate phytoplankton species in the region (, ). Silicate could be the limiting nutrient for diatoms during blooms, if they dominate the phytoplankton assemblage and consume Si/N in ratios $>$ 1; our ratios in all late summer situations were $<$ 1. Diatoms dominate over *Phaeocystis pouchetii* when sufficient silicate is present (\[$SiOH4>2μM$\]) (). Nevertheless, showed that diatom blooms sometimes do not deplete silicate, and that physical effects explained the variability in concentrations and ratios. Interannual variability and local differences in mixing may favour *Phaeocystis pouchetii* over diatoms and can affect the nutrient uptake ratios with nitrate depletion in presence of available silicate (). In our data, we see a generally nitrate-limited system where N/P and Si/N ratios suggest a mostly diatom dominated phytoplankton community. 2013 with higher N/P and lower Si/N might have experienced a larger influence of *Phaeocystis pouchetii* ().

The early winter transects in 2019 and 2021 showed a shift in nutrient ratios. The higher Si/N ratios might have resulted from lower silicate uptake during the growing season, and/or be a signal of dissolution of biogenic silica releasing silicate from diatom frustules (or mixing with high silicate water where dissolution has taken place) relative to rates of organic matter releasing nitrate in subsurface waters (). However, consistently lower Si/N relative to idealised ratios in both late summer and early winter across our transects indicate the impact of diatoms () and uptake of silicate during the growing season and resupply of nitrate before resupply of silicate due to faster remineralisation than silica dissolution.

The considerable spatial variability in nutrient distribution and ratios across the transects also reflects different physical drivers from the shelf into the deep basin, which act differently from year to year. 2012 and 2013 experienced a less extensive sea ice cover than 2015 and 2017, and late summer hydrography shows a deeper mixed layer and deeper nitracline in those low ice years as well. However, the pattern along the transect differs considerably with shallower mixed layer and a shallower upper AW boundary in 2013 further north (, ). At the same time, 2013 is characterised by higher nitrate and lower phosphate and silicate concentrations in the relatively cold and fresh AW and in the surface waters compared to 2012 (Tables S1 and S2), and N/P and Si/N ratios show large variability by latitude (). We suggest that a combination of an anomaly in the inflowing AW properties and large-scale circulation patterns connected to displacement of the Transpolar Drift () might have led to unusual water mass distribution especially along the northern, deep part of our transect, potentially impacting particularly the water masses from the surface to and including the (upper part of the) AW layer and causing the high fraction of modified Atlantic water in 2013 (). While a direct impact of riverine input of nutrients is unlikely in our study region, processes on the Siberian shelf such as primary production, denitrification, mixing, remineralisation and benthic cycling can modify nutrient concentrations in surface waters and sea ice formed there (, ). Advection of sea ice and surface waters with the Transpolar Drift spreads this signature of relatively low nitrate and high silicate and phosphate concentrations across the Central Arctic Ocean towards Fram Strait (). The slightly elevated silicate and Si/N in the PSW/wPSW surface layer in 2021 relative to the other years could have resulted from contributions from the Transpolar Drift (), which was deflected prior to the study period. A similar enhanced silicate signal was found in the Barents Sea in summer 2021 (). Additionally, the signal could have resulted from blooms of the haptophyte *Phaeocystis pouchetii*. We suggest that the variability in the location of the Transpolar Drift (), which is strongly influenced by the large-scale in the Arctic Ocean () can potentially lead to episodic input of Siberian-influenced surface waters at least to the deeper parts of our study region.

The relatively high ice years 2015 and 2017 experienced a slightly later sea ice retreat than 2012 and 2013 and accordingly later bloom start and peak (, S5). The stratification was strong with a shallow mixed layer depth in both 2015 and 2017, except for above the slope in 2015 (). The surface layer differed considerably between both years though with a cold and fresh layer over the entire transect in 2017 (). Interestingly, both years showed slightly higher nutrient concentrations in the surface waters than 2012 and 2013 (PSW and wPSW; , Table S2) but significant lower concentrations in the AW layer in 2015 compared to 2017; while the higher surface nutrient concentrations in 2017 corresponded with lower $chlsat$ integrated over the summer (potentially indicating less consumption) compared to 2015, the high nutrient concentrations in the AW layer in 2017 might have contributed the slightly elevated values in the PSW. Other markers such as high phaeophytin proportion and low fraction of $>$ 10 $μm$ chl *a* implying larger proportion of small phytoplankton in 2015 compared to 2017 suggest a later bloom stage and/or larger impact of grazing leading to degradation. Further upstream northwest of Svalbard, show high levels of primary production in August 2015, leading to low nitrate levels in the AW. In 2017 by contrast, their surface chl *a* concentrations were lower, and they suggest a greater role of input and mixing. Our transects were covered approximately two to three weeks later in the respective years, and we suggest that the large advective component of the AW inflow for hydrography (e.g., ), nutrients (), phytoplankton () and grazers (, ) strongly impacted our observations.

The early winter sampling years 2019 and 2021 were also two of the three years with lowest $chlsat$ integrated over the summer (only 2014 is lower), due to extensive and persistent sea ice coverage throughout 2019 and relatively late retreat in 2021. The difference in sea ice coverage and hydrography with stronger stratification in 2019 compared to 2021 (though reduced compared to the summer transects) was consistent with nutrient concentrations in the surface layers: While concentrations in the AW layer were similar to the other years, concentrations in PSW/wPSW were higher (, Table S2). Contraction of the upper layers in the *T–SA* diagrams () and lower $N2$ than in summer () were present in both years but stronger in 2021, supporting more advanced upward mixing (possibly due to stronger winds as discussed above) and beginning re-supply to the surface from below in 2021 than in 2019 even though sampling took place 10 days later in 2021. The difference in phytoplankton biomass and nutrient consumption over summer between the two years was likely overridden by physical processes driving vertical nutrient flux ().

### 4.5. Potential for autumn blooms with changing sea ice

The general increase in primary production across the Arctic Ocean (e.g., ) is accompanied and at least partially driven by a longer growth season due to longer ice-free periods () and by changes in phytoplankton phenology, including earlier onset of spring blooms due to earlier melt () and increased occurrence of autumn blooms (). These changes at the very base of the food web have implications for the functioning of the and are therefore critical for assessment of future trends ().

showed for the northern that overall, earlier sea and low winter ice concentrations lead to later onset of open bloom and increase in early bloom stages in mid-summer, whereas late ice retreat drives early ice-associated blooms. For individual years though, nutrient availability and stratification are the dominant drivers for bloom development. Our data from the other side of the Arctic suggest similar patterns with regards to timing of sea ice retreat and bloom occurrence. However, given the higher latitude of our observations and thus later sea ice retreat and light availability we reach similar stages in bloom development considerably later in the year, limiting the length of the growing season.

observed increased occurrence of autumn blooms in the in 2003–2017, dependent on vertical re-supply from nutrient-rich near bottom waters. Tied to , remineralisation of sinking material and autumn convection play a major role to bring nutrients back to the . On the Atlantic side, the shelf north of Svalbard and in the northern Barents Sea is deeper and thus less suitable for, e.g., shelf-break upwelling (), and contributions from benthic processes like remineralisation are seasonally limited; show strong pelagic–benthic coupling in the northern Barents Sea with high reactivity and regeneration of nutrients and organic material that contributes to of surface layers during winter deep convective mixing. Instead, the AW inflow provides a year-round source of nutrients. highlight the importance of this source for autumn chl *a* concentrations and blooms in the Barents Sea while state that advection of nutrients with AW alleviates light nutrient limitation north of Svalbard and increases primary production.

The reliance on the AW inflow as nutrient source for the Eurasian Arctic and even the Central Arctic Ocean raises concerns regarding trends in nutrient concentrations in the AW layer. Our time series is too short to assess trends, but demonstrates large variability in concentrations by water mass, similar to findings by . Our results suggest though that while AW clearly is a major source of nutrients for surface water, the mere presence of an AW layer is not sufficient when stratification is strong and limits vertical flux. Upwelling of nutrients can be driven by storm events (in the absence of sea ice), which are more frequent in autumn and can promote autumn mixing. Where this occurs early enough before light becomes limiting, autumn blooms can form (). Also, enhanced autumn and winter mixing can promote higher nutrient concentrations in spring and thus larger blooms. While the enhancement (or suppression) of spring blooms might be seen in our combined time series of sea ice concentration and $chlsat$, using low sea ice concentrations as a proxy for potential wind-driven mixing, we do not see signs of autumn blooms even when sea ice concentrations drop early in the productive season and allow early wind-driven mixing. Early September conditions at our latitudes (approx. 81.2-82 $°N$) rather resemble mature to post-bloom stages with nutrient-limitation in the surface layers, and we reckon that re-supply starts too late when light conditions become limiting as the sun set below the horizon in mid-October.

## 5\. Conclusions

We presented data on hydrography, inorganic nutrient distributions and chl *a* concentrations from repeat measurements of a transect north of Svalbard crossing the AW inflow into the Arctic Ocean, covering the period 2012–2021. Late summer measurements show post-bloom conditions for both nutrients and chl *a*, while early winter observations show the beginning of breakdown of stratification and re-supply of nutrients towards the surface layer. However, there is large interannual variability both in hydrography and upper ocean nutrient and chl *a* concentrations. While the AW inflow and its properties play an important role in steering this variability below the surface and regional winds impact the mixed layer, the sea ice cover in the region and its development over summer dominates signals at the surface by impacting bloom dynamics, stratification and import of surface waters from the Central Arctic Ocean. The advective regime of the AW inflow and advection of sea ice are major factors in the marine system north of Svalbard which can overrule local physical, chemical, and biological processes. With ongoing Atlantification, we can expect characteristics of the region north of Svalbard to spread eastward in the Eurasian Basin, including reduced sea ice cover and stronger influence of AW with its transport of nutrients and organisms. However, primary production along the AW pathway has the potential to deplete nutrients in the euphotic part of the AW layer while the layer extends to the surface and thus reduce nutrient concentrations advected downstream. Re-supply of nutrients may occur as soon as wind-driven mixing and winter convective mixing break down summer stratification. However, the timing and extent of wind-driven mixing and its efficiency in deepening the mixed layer are highly variable and impacted by the sea ice cover. We suggest that unlike on the Pacific inflow shelves of the Arctic Ocean (e.g., ), the weakening of stratification is still unlikely to occur early enough to allow the development of autumn blooms due to limited light availability at the high latitude of the AW inflow region.

	Alongside Atlantification, the Barents Sea experienced a 40 % decrease in freshwater input from sea ice melt from 1970 to 1999 (Lind et al., 2018), leading to a transition from a cold and stratified Arctic-like surface regime to a warmer, well-mixed Atlantic-dominated regime (Lind et al., 2018; Polyakov et al., 2020), with projected continuation of this trend (Muilwijk et al., 2023). A more mixed regime impacts light availability for primary producers (Petit et al., 2022), and may favor an influx of nutrients into the surface layer (Jones et al., 2023; Randelhoff et al., 2016; Renner et al., 2023), which drives the increase in primary production, a scenario supported by remote sensing (Kahru et al., 2016; Lewis et al., 2020). Observations, satellite data, and previous modeling studies have identified the inflow of sea ice from the Central Arctic Ocean and the inflow of Atlantic Water as the two primary factors influencing freshwater/stratification and local sea ice cover in the northern Barents Sea (Ellingsen et al., 2009; Koenigk et al., 2009; Lind et al., 2018; Aaboe et al., 2021; Efstathiou et al., 2022; Lundesgaard et al., 2022; Hordoir et al., 2022).
