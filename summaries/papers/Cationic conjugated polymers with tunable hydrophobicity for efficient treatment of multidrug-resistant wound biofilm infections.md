## 1\. Introduction

The rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria has resulted in a worldwide crisis arising from antibiotic-resistant infections \[, , \]. Widespread use and abuse of antibiotics have led to the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria that cause nearly 3 million life-threatening infections annually worldwide \[, , \]. The ability of bacteria to form biofilms results in refractory infections in wounds and medical implants \[\],\[\]. In the US alone, biofilm-associated infections are responsible for more than 1.7 million infections annually, with an economic burden of approximately 11 billion USD every year \[\].

Biofilm infections present unique therapeutic challenges, with the biofilm's extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) matrix providing a physical barrier against both host immune response and most conventional antimicrobial agents \[,\]. Bacteria within biofilms exhibit altered phenotypes that further complicate treatment, including difficult to kill persister cells \[\], as well as synergistic spatial and metabolic interactions and transfer of resistance genes \[,\]. As a result, biofilm infections often require aggressive strategies that use high doses of antibiotics coupled with the invasive surgery to remove infected tissue (debridement) \[\]. These approaches lead to expensive treatment costs and often entail patient suffering and adverse side effects. Without adequate measures, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria have the potential to emerge as drivers of a devastating global pandemic \[, , \].

Antimicrobial polymers provide a promising platform to combat antibiotic-resistant bacterial and biofilm infections. Cationic amine/ammonium- or guanidinium-rich polymers can effectively penetrate the charged biofilm matrix, providing *in situ* bacterial killing \[\],\[\]. The unique physiochemical characteristics of these polymers can be attributed to their amphiphilic properties through the proper balance between hydrophobic and cationic moieties, enabling disruption of microbial membranes and impairing the intrinsic resistance of bacteria \[, , \]. However, achieving the required amphiphilic balance for selective bacterial killing has proven challenging, with mammalian toxicity of these polymers providing a major barrier to their clinical utility \[\].

Polymeric platforms that provide intrinsic and simultaneous fluorescence imaging and treatment of antibiotic-refractory biofilm infections have the potential to be used as multi-modal therapeutics \[,\]. Conjugated polymers have useful optical properties \[,\], with many having high intrinsic fluorescence \[, , \]. Poly(phenylene ethynylene) (PPE) polymers \[, , \] are promising platforms for biocidal applications due to their facially amphiphilic nature that mimics the structure and biological nature of host defense peptides and antimicrobial peptides \[\],\[\]. Here, we report the synthesis of a library of cationic alternating PPE copolymers (**CP\_C** <sub><strong>n</strong></sub> **\_TMA**) with variable alkyl side chain lengths. These polymers feature sidechains terminated with trimethylammonium (TMA) groups for interaction with negatively charged bacterial membranes \[\] and EPS \[\]. The alkyl linker between the polymer and TMA group was varied to modulate polymer-membrane interactions \[\],\[\]. An alternating copolymer strategy employing an oligo(ethylene glycol) functional group was used to provide solubility to the **CP\_C** <sub><strong>n</strong></sub> **\_TMA** polymers \[\],\[\]. Increasing the alkyl spacer of the polymer enhanced antimicrobial efficacy, with the best activity observed with **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA**, the most hydrophobic polymer with aqueous solubility. Based on previous studies, it is highly likely that there is an optimal hydrophobicity to target when designing these polymers \[,\]. A careful balance was considered in the design to maximize the efficacy of these polymers while retaining water solubility. The intrinsic fluorescence of these polymers allowed label-free monitoring of bacteria-polymer interaction with confocal microscopy. **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** displayed efficient biofilm penetration and antibiofilm activity *in vitro* against several MDR bacterial biofilms, with no mammalian cell toxicity observed at concentrations used for biofilm eradication. **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** was likewise highly effective *in vivo* against a murine wound biofilm model of MDR *Acinetobacter baumanii*, eradicating >99.9 % (∼3 log units) of bacterial burden. This efficient biofilm clearance resulted in a dramatic reduction in biofilm-associated inflammatory responses in mice treated with **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA**. Taken together, this PPE alternating copolymer scaffold provides a promising antimicrobial and imaging platform for the treatment of refractory wound biofilm infections.

## 2\. Methods

### 2.1. Antimicrobial activity of CP\_Cn\_TMAs against planktonic bacteria

Lysogeny broth (LB) was used as the growth medium for the bacteria suspensions and the bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C to allow it to reach the stationary phase. Next, bacteria were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with 0.85 % sodium chloride solution. Optical density, measured at 600 nm, was utilized to assess the concentration of the bacteria. Suspensions of bacteria were prepared in M9 minimal media at an OD <sub>600</sub> of 0.001. Polymer stock solutions were prepared in DMSO. The stocks were then diluted with M9 minimal media, PBS or cell culture media for appropriate experiments. 50 μL of polymers and bacteria suspensions were combined in a 96-well plate. Wells incubated with bacterial suspension or a sterile M9 solution were used as controls and the plates were kept overnight at 37 °C while shaking. MIC was determined both through visual inspection and OD <sub>600</sub> measurements and the experiments were measured in triplicates.

### 2.2. Determining selectivity/therapeutic indices through hemolysis assay of CP\_Cn\_TMAs

Mixed-gender pooled human whole blood was acquired from BioIVT Elevating Science and processed promptly upon receipt. Centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min was used to extract red blood cells. After washing the cells four times with PBS buffer, they were diluted in PBS to a final concentration of about 5 % (v/v). CP\_C <sub>11</sub> \_TMA were serially diluted in PBS and then 200 μL was added to each well in a 96-well plate. After adding 20 μL of blood cell suspension per well, the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 150 r.p.m. shaking. Triton X-100 (1 %) and PBS were used as the positive and negative controls, respectively. Following the incubation period, 120 μL of the supernatant was transferred to a container after the mixture was centrifuged for 7 min at 3000 r.p.m. The absorbance was measured at 560 nm, and hemolysis was computed using the formula below.

### 2.3. Confirming biofilm penetration and elimination through confocal laser scanning microscopy

RFP-expressing *E. coli* bacteria were allowed to grow for 4 days for biofilm formation. These biofilms were then incubated with prepared CP\_C <sub>11</sub> \_TMA (green fluorescence) polymer solution for 1 h at 37 °C. The ability of the polymer to penetrate the biofilm was studied through a Nikon A1 spectral detector confocal with FLIM module. The penetration profile was studied using the Nikon A1 resonant scanning confocal with TIRF module. The resulting images were processed using NIS-Elements.

### 2.4. Selection of resistance

*A. baumannii* (CD-575) or *E. coli* (CD-2) was incubated into M9 media that contained sub-inhibitory doses of levofloxacin and vancomycin, respectively, at 66 % MIC. The bacteria suspension of each antibiotic was identified as the first passage, collected, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations assessed. Bacteria were cultured without antimicrobial agents to serve as a control. This process was successively repeated by incubating the bacteria to 66 % MIC of the preceding therapeutic concentration for a total of 15 passages.

### 2.5. Ethics statement

C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Envigo (Indianapolis, IN). The mice were kept in sterile cages with a 12-h light/dark cycle. Before beginning any of the operations, they were given at least two days to acclimate. All animal experiments were carried out following an approved IACUC Protocol ID 2648 that was accredited through Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International and cleared by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (AAALAC #000717).

### 2.6. In vivo wound biofilm murine model

The C57BL/6 mice were used to create the biofilm model. The skin on their dorsum was cleaned with a sterile alcohol pad and povidone-iodine solution after they had been given anesthesia. Then, using a skin puncture biopsy instrument, a sterile 5-mm circular full-thickness skin incision was punctured. Next, 10 <sup>6</sup>  colony-forming units (CFU) of *A. baumannii* (CD-575) in saline (10 μL) were injected into the wound bed using a micropipette. To stop further bacterial infection, semi-occlusive transparent Tegaderm® was applied over the wound and secured with Vetbond®. For a full day, biofilms were left to grow, and IVIS imaging of the glowing bacteria in the wound bed confirmed that each mouse was infected. After that, mice were divided into three groups of five at random and given one of the following treatments: a) PBS, b) tigecycline, or c) CP\_C <sub>11</sub> \_TMA polymer. The tested agents were topically administered once daily for four days. The concentrations used were 100 mg/kg/day for tigecycline and 8 mg/kg/day for CP-11. On the day of the sacrifice, CO2 asphyxiation was used to kill the mice. Subsequently, a skin biopsy punch was used to obtain 3-mm circular full-thickness skin from the inner infection area to perform qRT-PCR to check for inflammatory markers and determine the bacterial count.

## 3\. Results and discussion

### 3.1. Generation of functionalized CP\_Cn\_TMA

The density and distribution of hydrophobic moieties is a key driver for their antimicrobial potency \[\],\[\]. In particular, the proper ratio of hydrophobicity and cationic charge is critical in ensuring antimicrobial selectivity towards bacteria over mammalian cells \[\],\[\]. We explored this design space by synthesizing a library of cationic conjugated alternating PPE co-polymers with varying hydrophobicity. The design of these polymers features three key components: 1) the linear π-conjugated phenylene ethynylene backbone to serve as intrinsic chromophores; 2) aliphatic alkyl side chain moieties with cationic quaternary ammonium headgroup for interaction with and disruption of bacterial membranes \[\], and 3) tetra(ethylene glycol) moieties to enhance aqueous solubility \[\],\[\]. We employed an alternating co-polymer approach to avoid solubility challenges encountered in manipulating the homopolymer system, especially at longer alkyl side chain design.

Alternating copolymers were generated using 1,4-bis(oxyalkylmethylene-trimethylammonium bromide)-2,5-diiodobenzene and 1,4-Bis\[(tetraethyleneglycol monomethylether)oxy\]-2,5-diethynylbenzene to prepare the **CP\_C** <sub><strong>n</strong></sub> **\_TMA** library (a) \[, , \]. The 1,4-bis(oxyalkylmethylene-trimethylammonium bromide)-2,5-diiodobenzene monomer unit provides the cationic charge required for the antimicrobial properties while the 1,4-bis\[(tetraethyleneglycol monomethylether)oxy\]-2,5-diethynylbenzene monomer provides aqueous solubility. Sonogashira polymerization was used for the generation of the **CP\_C** <sub><strong>n</strong></sub> **\_TMA** library \[\]. A palladium (II) catalyst (Bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II)dichloride) along with the copper(I)iodide co-catalyst (CuI) were used for polymerization. This polycondensation follows a step-growth polymerization mechanism which leads to the formation of a relatively wide molecular weight distribution and hence a higher polydispersity index \[\]. The synthesis of the alternating co-polymer library with varying unbranched alkyl chain lengths connecting the cationic quaternary ammonium headgroup with the rod-like **CP\_C** <sub><strong>n</strong></sub> **\_TMA** backbone itself () allowed for systemic investigation of the structure-antimicrobial activity relationship. The facially amphiphilic nature of the PPEs enabled the appropriate molecular architecture for investigating their antimicrobial properties. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to measure the molecular weight and the polydispersity of the polymer library in trifluoroethanol (poly(methyl methacrylate) as standard) (a and ). The hydrodynamic diameter of the **CP\_C** <sub><strong>n</strong></sub> **\_TMA** family was determined through dynamic light scattering (DLS) as shown in b. The DLS data show the formation of extended aggregates in the range of 250–500 nm in aqueous solution. Polyphenylene can aggregate in water \[\], so representing the size by intensity will skew the distribution heavily towards the few aggregated particles. We represented the data in volume to have a more representative depiction of the hydrodynamic volume of the polymer in solution. The results from the DLS were consistent with the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images acquired (c). The photophysical properties of the **CP\_C** <sub><strong>n</strong></sub> **\_TMA** were evaluated in water and revealed a red shift in fluorescence emission with the increase of the length of the alkyl side chains of the polymers consistent with changes in aggregation with increasing hydrophobicity () \[\].

### 3.2. Antimicrobial activity of CP\_Cn\_TMAs against planktonic bacteria

We first screened the antibacterial activity of **CP\_C** <sub><strong>n</strong></sub> **\_TMA** library against planktonic bacteria, determining minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against multiple bacterial strains. Clinical isolates of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (CD-1006), *Escherichia coli* (CD-2), *Acinetobacter baumannii* (CD-575), *Klebsiella pneumoniae* (CD-343), and methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (CD-489) were used for the antimicrobial activity assay. All **CP\_C** <sub><strong>n</strong></sub> **\_TMA** polymers displayed high antibacterial activity against all Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains, with MIC values ranging between 0.125 and 16 μM (a). The antibacterial effect significantly improved with the increase in the alkyl spacer, with **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** having the lowest MIC values against all tested strains ranging from 0.125 to 1 μM.

### 3.3. Selectivity and therapeutic indices of CP\_Cn\_TMAs

After assessing the antimicrobial efficacy, we proceeded to study the mammalian cell toxicity of the polymers against NIH-3T3 fibroblast (ATCC CRL-1658) cells to determine the IC <sub>50</sub> (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) of the polymers against host cells and evaluate their fibroblast selectivity index (SI). Fibroblasts play critical roles in wound healing processes and tissue regeneration that are hampered by the presence of bacteria and the formation of biofilms \[\]. All four conjugated polymers showed low toxicity to fibroblast cells with IC <sub>50</sub>  > 64 μM (b). The SI against a particular bacteria *A. baumannii* was calculated as IC <sub>50</sub> /MIC <sub><em>A. baumannii</em></sub> which provides a metric for measuring selectivity of the polymer to kill bacteria without significant effects on mammalian cell viability. Conjugated polymer **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** displayed the highest SI (260 against *A. baumannii*) compared to the other polymers (c). These results indicate that the hydrophobicity of conjugated polymers plays a crucial role in enhancing both their antimicrobial efficacy and selectivity relative to mammalian cells \[\]. We also investigated the hemolytic activity of **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** on human RBCs. As shown in d, **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** showed minimal hemolytic activity at concentrations capable of killing bacteria, with a SI > 250 against *A. baumannii* (SI was calculated as HC <sub>50</sub> /MIC <sub><em>A. baumannii</em></sub>) (d). The markedly enhanced selectivity of **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** with both fibroblasts and RBCs focused our further studies on this polymer.

### 3.4. Biofilm penetration and elimination by CP\_C11\_TMA

We next investigated the efficacy of **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** against MDR bacterial biofilms. Microbial biofilms present therapeutic challenges in several wound and implant-related infections since bacteria within biofilms can be 10-1000-fold less susceptible to antimicrobial therapy compared to their planktonic counterparts \[\],\[\]. We first evaluated the ability of **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** to penetrate into the biofilms using confocal microscopy. **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** exhibits strong green fluorescence that makes it a dye-free imaging probe, facilitating tracking of the polymer biofilm penetration. Red fluorescent protein (RFP) expressing *E. coli* was chosen as a model biofilm (4-day-old) and the polymer was incubated with the biofilm \[, , \]. a shows the polymer penetration into the biofilm matrix efficiently after 3 h as evidenced by the distribution of the green fluorescence signals through deep layers of the biofilms. Moreover, the colocalization of the green and red fluorescence signals indicates the ability of the polymer to penetrate and accumulate within the bacteria.

We next evaluated the antibiofilm activity of **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** against clinical isolates of four pathogenic MDR bacteria, *E. coli* (CD-2), *A. baumannii* (CD-575), MRSA (CD-489), and *K. pneumoniae* (IDRL-11999). Mature 4-day biofilms were incubated with different concentrations of **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** and Alamar blue assay was performed to quantify the viability of the bacteria within the biofilms. As shown in b–e, **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** demonstrated potent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial biofilms at concentrations much lower than required by standard antibiotics (). Moreover, **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** efficiently inhibited the formation of biofilms of these MDR species with MBIC (minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration) as low as 4 μM ( and ). In addition to the antibiofilm activity as measured through Alamar blue assay, we performed additional experiments to check the effect of **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** on the EPS of biofilms. EPS biomass quantification using a crystal violet staining assay showed that **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** resulted in a >80 % reduction in the EPS biomass in a dose-dependent manner compared to untreated control ().

We next used an *in vitro* biofilm-mammalian cell coculture model to simultaneously assess the antibiofilm activity and host toxicity of the conjugated polymer platform \[\]. *E. coli* (CD-2) or *A. baumannii* (CD-575) were incubated on top of a single layer of NIH 3T3-fibroblast cells (ATCC CRL-1658) for 6 h to allow the formation of the biofilm. Subsequently, the cocultures were treated with different concentrations of **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** for 6 h. A lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay and colony counting were performed to check the viability of the fibroblasts and biofilm bacteria, respectively. As shown in f and g, **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** efficiently reduced the biofilm bacterial load by > 4 log <sub>10</sub>  colony-forming units (CFU) for both *E. coli* (CD-2) or *A. baumannii* (CD-575) with minimal fibroblast toxicity. We extended this study to see the antimicrobial effect of **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** on physiologically relevant polymicrobial biofilms. **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** showed MBIC values of 4 and 8 μM against dual-species biofilms of *A. baumannii* (CD-575) and *E. coli* (CD-2), and MRSA (CD-489) and *E. coli* (CD-2) respectively ().

### 3.5. Mechanism of antimicrobial activity and selection of resistance

The broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** suggests that activity arises from its ability to disrupt bacterial membranes \[\],\[\]. Membrane integrity was probed through membrane-impermeable propidium iodide (PI) staining. Mature 4-day-old *A. baumannii* (CD-575) biofilms were first incubated with **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** (green fluorescence) for 3 h and the biofilms were then stained with PI (red fluorescence). Confocal studies showed the presence of high levels of co-localized PI and **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** signals indicative of membrane disruption (a). We conducted a parallel control experiment of a mature 4-day-old *E. coli* biofilm stained with SYTO-9 (green fluorescence) and PI to validate that the PI stain was generated from membrane disruption and not from extracellular DNA in the biofilm. The results confirm that PI does not stain eDNA in the biofilm, unlike the staining seen in dead cells after treatment with CP-C11-TMA (). Additionally, we used a cell membrane potential-sensitive probe DiSC3(5) for further characterization of the antimicrobial mechanism of **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** \[\]. DiSC3(5) accumulates within cells with polarized membranes where it exhibits self-quenched fluorescence. Membrane depolarization disrupts the proton gradient across the bacterial membrane, which is essential for ATP synthesis \[\]. Loss of membrane potential impairs key cellular processes, including nutrient uptake, ATP production, and ion homeostasis, which are critical for maintaining cellular integrity and function. This disruption leads to failure of essential metabolic pathways, causing energy depletion and a shutdown of biosynthetic activities, ultimately resulting in bacterial cell death \[\]. Once the cell membrane is disrupted and loses its membrane potential, the dye is released into the media causing a rapid increase in fluorescence intensity. The addition of **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** in the bacterial suspension of either *A. baumannii* or MRSA results in a rapid increase in fluorescence intensity in a dose-dependent manner (b and c), indicating that **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** interacts with the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and causes membrane disruption and depolarization in a dose-dependent fashion.

Evasion of antimicrobial tolerance/resistance is a highly desirable attribute for new therapeutics \[\],\[\]. Membrane-disrupting antimicrobials provide a mechanism that can slow or prevent resistance development \[\],\[\]. Resistance development of **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** in *A. baumannii* (CD-575) or MRSA (CD-489) was compared with control antibiotics, tetracycline for *A. baumannii* and vancomycin for MRSA. Bacteria were incubated with sublethal concentrations (66 % MIC) of **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** or antibiotic. Notably, **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** did not show generation of resistance even after 15 serial passages with *A. baumannii* or MRSA (d and e). In contrast, both *A. baumannii* and MRSA acquired high levels of resistance against conventional antibiotics during serial passage. The inability of the bacteria to develop resistance against **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** can be attributed to the ability of the polymer to damage the bacterial cell envelope. Membrane-disrupting antimicrobial agents generally target the structural and physical properties of the bacterial membrane, rather than having a specific molecular or enzymatic target as used by antibiotics, making it difficult for bacteria to evolve targeted mutations that would confer resistance without compromising essential membrane functions \[\]. This lack of resistance development highlights the potential of these conjugated polymers as long-term antimicrobial therapeutics.

### 3.6. In vivo activity of CP\_C11\_TMA against murine wound biofilm model

*In vivo* pre-clinical models provide essential information for translating antimicrobials to the clinic \[\],\[\]. The antimicrobial activity of **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** was tested *in vivo* against a murine wound biofilm model of *A. baumannii* infection. In this model, a 5-mm skin punch was used to create a wound on the dorsum of a mouse, and the resulting wound was infected with 10 <sup>7</sup>  CFU/animal of *A. baumannii* (CD-575). Scanning electron microscopy was used to confirm the formation of *A. baumannii* wound biofilm, where microcolonies of *A. baumannii* were visualized covering the entire wound area after 24 h of bacteria inoculation (b). After the wound was infected with *A. baumannii* for 24 h, three groups of 5 mice were randomized to receive one of the following treatments: a) PBS, b) tigecycline, or c) **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA**. Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum tetracycline antibiotic with potent activity against *A. baumannii* infections and was hence chosen as a positive control \[, , \]. The tested agents were topically administered once daily for four days. Mice were sacrificed 24 h after the last treatment, and the inner wound area (3-mm) was harvested for quantitative colony counting. A > 3 log <sub>10</sub>  CFU reduction of bacteria (>99.9 % bacterial killing) was observed for **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** compared to the untreated group. Notably, **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** was even more potent than tigecycline, which only showed a 2 log <sub>10</sub>  CFU bacteria reduction (c). The polymer was applied topically to the wound site, with the low dosing and local administration expected to strongly limit access to the bloodstream.

An effective inflammatory response in the early phases of bacterial infections helps in the clearance of pathogens from the wound site \[\]. However, bacterial biofilm infections in wound sites generate a prolonged and substantial pro-inflammatory response that delays the healing processes, resulting in wound persistence \[\]. Wound tissues were evaluated for pro-inflammatory markers TNF-α and iNOS. TNF-α and iNOS mRNA levels were evaluated using RT-PCR on the day of sacrifice (day 4). As shown in d and e, the levels of these inflammatory markers, in particular, were substantially reduced in mice treated with either tigecycline or **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA**. A significantly greater decrease in iNOS levels were observed with **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** and tigecycline, with similar levels of TNF-α seen with the two treatments. Overall, these results highlight the therapeutic potential of **CP\_C** <sub><strong>11</strong></sub> **\_TMA** in eradicating bacteria in wound biofilm infections with a concomitant reduction in inflammation.

## 4\. Conclusions

In summary, we have developed a family of cationic conjugated alternating copolymers that provide an efficient platform for treating antibiotic-resistant wound biofilm infections. Our studies demonstrate that careful tuning of the hydrophobic moieties within the synthetic conjugated polymer scaffold provides potent antimicrobial activity and low mammalian fibroblast and red blood cell toxicity. The amphiphilic **CP\_C** <sub><strong>n</strong></sub> **\_TMA** showed impressive antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative planktonic bacteria and corresponding biofilms while maintaining minimal mammalian cytotoxicity. Mechanistic studies revealed that the polymers kill bacteria through bacterial membrane disruption. This disruption prevented the development of antimicrobial resistance over 15 serial passages. The therapeutic potential of this platform was tested in an *in vivo* murine model, exhibiting significant antimicrobial activity against *A. baumannii* wound biofilm infections. Future studies will focus on the introducing biodegradability to this platform and evaluating long-term toxicity studies arising from systemic administration in animal models. In addition, we will also evaluate the long-term wound healing properties of these polymers. Altogether, this approach highlights the potential of conjugated polymers as a therapeutic tool for MDR bacterial infections. The multi-modal approach afforded by the simultaneous imaging and treatment and the modularity of the **CP\_C** <sub><strong>n</strong></sub> **\_TMA** platform provides a translatable antimicrobial platform for addressing difficult-to-treat wound biofilm infections while circumventing conventional antibiotic resistance mechanisms.
